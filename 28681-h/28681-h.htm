Oracle, and Housekeeper&#8217;s Manual,&#8221; with numerous and valuable
improvements, by a medical gentleman of this city.</p>

<p>The work contains a store of valuable information, which, it is
confidently believed, will not only prove highly advantageous to young
and inexperienced housekeepers, but also to more experienced matrons&mdash;to
all, indeed, who are desirous of enjoying, in the highest degree, the
good things which Nature has so abundantly bestowed upon us.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Cook&#8217;s Oracle&#8221; has been adjudged, by connoisseurs in this country
and in Great Britain, to contain the best possible instructions on the
subject of serving up, beautifully and economically, the productions of
the water, land, and air, in such a manner as to render them most
pleasant to the eye, and agreeable to the palate.</p>

<p>Numerous notices, in commendation of the work, might be selected from
respectable European journals; but the mere fact, that within twelve
years, seventy thousand copies of it have been purchased by the English
public, is sufficient evidence of its reception and merits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> whole of this Work has, a <i>seventh time</i>, been carefully revised;
but this last time I have found little to add, and little to alter.</p>

<p>I have bestowed as much attention on each of the 500 receipts as if the
whole merit of the book was to be estimated entirely by the accuracy of
my detail of one particular process.</p>

<p>The increasing demand for &#8220;<i>The Cook&#8217;s Oracle</i>,&#8221; amounting in 1824 to
the extraordinary number of upwards of 45,000, has been stimulus enough
to excite any man to submit to the most unremitting study; and the
Editor has felt it as an imperative duty to exert himself to the utmost
to render &#8220;<i>The Cook&#8217;s Oracle</i>&#8221; a faithful narrative of all that is
known of the various subjects it professes to treat.</p>

<hr class="declong" />

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the multitudes of causes which concur to impair health and produce
disease, the most general is the improper quality of our food: this most
frequently arises from the injudicious manner in which it is prepared:
yet strange, &#8220;passing strange,&#8221; this is the only one for which a remedy
has not been sought; few persons bestow half so much attention on the
preservation of their own health, as they daily devote to that of their
dogs and horses.</p>

<p>The observations of the Guardians of Health respecting regimen, &amp;c. have
formed no more than a catalogue of those articles of food, which they
have considered most proper for particular constitutions.</p>

<p>Some medical writers have, &#8220;in good set terms,&#8221; warned us against the
pernicious effects of improper diet; but not one has been so kind as to
take the trouble to direct us how to prepare food properly; excepting
only the contributions of Count Rumford, who says, in pages 16 and 70 of
his tenth Essay, &#8220;however low and vulgar this subject has hitherto
generally been thought to be&mdash;<i>in what Art or Science could improvements
be made that would more powerfully contribute to increase the comforts
and enjoyments of mankind? Would to God! that I could fix the public
attention to this subject!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The Editor has endeavoured to write the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> receipts so plainly,
that they may be as easily understood in the kitchen as he trusts they
will be relished in the dining-room; and has been more ambitious to
present to the Public a Work which will contribute to the daily comfort
of all, than to seem elaborately scientific.</p>

<p>The practical part of the philosophy of the kitchen is certainly not the
most agreeable; gastrology has to contend with its full share of those
great impediments to all great improvements in scientific pursuits; the
prejudices of the ignorant, and the misrepresentations of the envious.</p>

<p>The sagacity to comprehend and estimate the importance of any
uncontemplated improvement, is confined to the very few on whom nature
has bestowed a sufficient degree of perfection of the sense which is to
measure it;&mdash;the candour to make a fair report of it, is still more
uncommon; and the kindness to encourage it cannot often be expected from
those whose most vital interest it is to prevent the developement of
that by which their own importance, perhaps their only means of
existence, may be for ever eclipsed: so, as Pope says, how many are</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Condemn&#8217;d in business or in arts to drudge,<br />
Without a rival, or without a judge:<br />
All fear, none aid you, and few understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Improvements in <i>Agriculture</i> and the <i>Breed of Cattle</i> have been
encouraged by premiums. Those who have obtained them, have been hailed
as benefactors to society! but <i>the Art of</i> making use of these means of
<i>ameliorating Life and supporting a healthful Existence</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cookery</span>&mdash;has
been neglected!!</p>

<p>While the cultivators of the raw materials are distinguished and
rewarded, the attempt to improve the pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>cesses, without which neither
vegetable nor animal substances are fit for the food of man (astonishing
to say), has been ridiculed, as unworthy the attention of a rational
being!!</p>

<p>The most useful<a name="FNanchor_VII-1_1" id="FNanchor_VII-1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_VII-1_1" class="fnanchor">vii-*</a> art&mdash;which the Editor has chosen to endeavour to
illustrate, because nobody else has, and because he knew not how he
could employ some leisure hours more beneficially for mankind, than to
teach them to combine the &#8220;<i>utile</i>&#8221; with the &#8220;<i>dulce</i>,&#8221; and to increase
their pleasures, without impairing their health, or impoverishing their
fortune, has been for many years his favourite employment; and &#8220;<span class="smcap">The Art
of Invigorating and Prolonging Life by Food, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>&#8221; and this Work,
have insensibly become repositories for whatever observations he has
made which he thought would make us &#8220;<span class="smcap">Live Happy, and Live Long!!!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The Editor has considered the <span class="smcap">Art of Cookery</span>, not merely as a mechanical
operation, fit only for working cooks, but as the <i>Analeptic part of the
Art of Physic</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">is an occupation neither unbecoming nor unworthy philosophers of the
highest class: such only can comprehend its importance; which amounts to
no less, than not only the enjoyment of the present moment, but the more
precious advantage of improving and preserving <i>health</i>, and prolonging
<i>life</i>, which depend on duly replenishing the daily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> waste of the human
frame with materials pregnant with nutriment and easy of digestion.</p>

<p>If <i>medicine</i> be ranked among those arts which dignify their professors,
<i>cookery</i> may lay claim to an equal, if not a superior, distinction; to
<i>prevent</i> diseases is surely a more advantageous art to mankind than to
<i>cure</i> them. &#8220;Physicians should be good cooks, at least in theory.&#8221;&mdash;<a name="corr1" id="corr1"></a>Dr.
<span class="smcap">Mandeville</span> <i>on Hypochondriasis</i>, p. 316.</p>

<p>The learned Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span> observes, in page 3 of the preface to his
<i>Essay on Aliment</i>, that &#8220;the choice and measure of the materials of
which our body is composed, what we take daily by <i>pounds</i>, is at least
of as much importance as what we take seldom, and only by <i>grains</i> and
spoonfuls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those in whom the organ of taste is obtuse, or who have been brought up
in the happy habit of being content with humble fare, whose health is so
firm, that it needs no artificial adjustment; who, with the appetite of
a cormorant, have the digestion of an ostrich, and eagerly devour
whatever is set before them without asking any questions about what it
is, or how it has been prepared&mdash;may perhaps imagine that the Editor has
sometimes been rather over-much refining the business of the kitchen.</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Where ignorance is bliss, &#8217;tis folly to be wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as few are so fortunate as to be trained up to understand how well
it is worth their while to cultivate such habits of Spartan forbearance,
we cannot perform our duty in registering wholesome precepts, in a
higher degree, than by disarming luxury of its sting, and making the
refinements of Modern Cookery minister not merely to sensual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
gratification, but at the same time support the substantial excitement
of &#8220;mens sana in corpore sano.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Delicate and nervous invalids</i>, who have unfortunately a sensitive
palate, and have been accustomed to a luxurious variety of savoury
sauces, and highly seasoned viands; those who, from the infirmity of
age, are become incapable of correcting habits created by absurd
indulgence in youth, are entitled to some consideration; and, for their
sake, the <i>Elements of Opsology</i> are explained in the most intelligent
manner; and I have assisted the memory of young cooks, by annexing to
each dish the various sauces which usually accompany it, referring to
their numbers in the work.</p>

<p>Some idle idiots have remarked to the Author, that &#8220;there were really so
many <i>references</i> from one receipt to another, that it is exceedingly
troublesome indeed; they are directed sometimes to turn to half a dozen
numbers:&#8221; this is quite true. If the Author had not adopted this plan of
<i>reference</i>, his book, to be equally explicit, must have been ten times
as big; his object has been to give as much information as possible in
as few pages, and for as few pence, as possible.</p>

<p>By reducing culinary operations to something like a certainty,
<i>invalids</i> will no longer be entirely indebted to chance, whether they
shall recover and live long, and comfortably, or speedily die of
starvation in the midst of plenty.</p>

<p>These rules and orders for the regulation of the business of the kitchen
have been extremely beneficial to the Editor&#8217;s own health and comfort.
He hopes they will be equally so to others: they will help those who
enjoy health to preserve it; teach those who have delicate and irritable
stomachs how to keep them in good temper; and, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span> little
discretion, enable them to indulge occasionally, not only with impunity,
but with advantage, in all those alimentary pleasures which a rational
epicure can desire.</p>

<p>There is no question more frequently asked, or which a medical man finds
more difficulty in answering, to the satisfaction of himself and his
patient, than&mdash;<i>What do you wish me to eat?</i></p>

<p>The most judicious choice of aliment will <a name="corr2" id="corr2"></a>avail nothing, unless the
culinary preparation of it be equally judicious. How often is the skill
of a pains-taking physician counteracted by want of corresponding
attention to the preparation of food; and the poor patient, instead of
deriving nourishment, is distressed by indigestion!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parmentier</span>, in his <i>Code Pharmaceutique</i>, has given a chapter on the
preparation of food: some of the following receipts are offered as an
humble attempt to form a sort of <i>Appendix to the Pharmacop&oelig;ia</i>, and
like pharmaceutic prescriptions, they are precisely adjusted by <i>weight</i>
and <i>measure</i>. The author of a cookery book, first published in 1824,
has claimed this act of industry of mine as his own original invention;
the only notice I shall take of his pretensions is to say, that the
first edition of &#8220;<i>The Cook&#8217;s Oracle</i>&#8221; appeared in 1817.</p>

<p>By ordering such receipts of the <i>Cook&#8217;s Oracle</i> as appear adapted to
the case, the recovery of the patient and the credit of the physician,
as far as relates to the administration of aliment, need no longer
depend on the discretion of the cook. For instance: <i>Mutton Broth</i>, <a href="#no_490">No.
490</a>, or <a href="#no_564">No. 564</a>; <i>Toast and Water</i>, <a href="#no_463">No. 463</a>; <i>Water Gruel</i>, <a href="#no_572">No. 572</a>;
<i>Beef Tea</i>, <a href="#no_563">No. 563</a>; and <i>Portable Soup</i>, <a href="#no_252">No. 252</a>. This concentrated
<i>Essence of Meat</i> will be found a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span> acquisition to the comfort of
the army, the navy, the traveller, and the invalid. By dissolving half
an ounce of it in half a pint of hot water, you have in a few minutes
<i>half a pint of good Broth for three halfpence</i>. The utility of such
accurate and precise directions for preparing food, is to <i>travellers</i>
incalculable; for, by translating the receipt, any person may prepare
what is desired as perfectly as a good English cook.</p>

<p>He has also circumstantially detailed the easiest, least expensive, and
most salubrious methods of preparing those highly finished soups,
sauces, rago&ucirc;ts, and <i>piquante</i> relishes, which the most ingenious
&#8220;officers of the mouth&#8221; have invented for the amusement of thorough-bred
&#8220;<i>grands gourmands</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It has been his aim to render food acceptable to the palate, without
being expensive to the purse, or offensive to the stomach; nourishing
without being inflammatory, and savoury without being surfeiting;
constantly endeavouring to hold the balance equal, between the agreeable
and the wholesome, the epicure and the economist.</p>

<p><i>He has not presumed to recommend one receipt that has not been
previously and repeatedly proved in his own kitchen</i>, which has not been
approved by the most accomplished cooks; and has, moreover, been eaten
with unanimous applause by <i>a Committee of Taste</i>, composed of some of
the most illustrious gastropholists of this luxurious metropolis.</p>

<p>The Editor has been materially assisted by Mr. Henry Osborne, the
excellent cook to the late Sir Joseph Banks; that worthy President of
the Royal Society was so sensible of the importance of the subject the
Editor was investi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>gating, that he sent his cook to assist him in his
arduous task; and many of the receipts in this edition are much improved
by his suggestions and corrections. See <a href="#no_560">No. 560</a>.</p>

<p><i>This is the only English Cookery Book</i> which has been written from the
real experiments of a <i>housekeeper</i> for the benefit of <i>housekeepers</i>;
which the reader will soon perceive by the minute attention that has
been employed to elucidate and improve the <i>Art of Plain Cookery</i>;
detailing many particulars and precautions, which may at first appear
frivolous, but which experience will prove to be essential: to teach a
common cook how to provide, and to prepare, common food so frugally, and
so perfectly, that <i>the plain every-day family fare of the most
economical housekeeper</i>, may, with scarcely additional expense, or any
additional trouble, be <i>a satisfactory entertainment for an epicure or
an invalid</i>.</p>

<p>By an attentive consideration of &#8220;<i>the Rudiments of Cookery</i>,&#8221; and the
respective receipts, the most <i>ignorant novice</i> in the business of the
kitchen, may work with the utmost facility and certainty of success, and
soon become <i>a good cook</i>.</p>

<p>Will all the other books of cookery that ever were printed do this? To
give his readers an idea of the immense labour attendant upon this Work,
it may be only necessary for the Author to state, that he has patiently
pioneered through more than <i>two hundred cookery books</i> before he set
about recording these results of his own experiments! The table of <i>the
most economical family</i> may, by the help of this book, be entertained
with as much elegance as that of <i>a sovereign prince</i>.</p>

<h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following receipts are not a mere marrowless collection of shreds
and patches, and cuttings and pastings, but a bon&acirc; fide register of
practical facts,&mdash;accumulated by a perseverance not to be subdued or
evaporated by the igniferous terrors of a roasting fire in the
dog-days,&mdash;in defiance of the odoriferous and calefacient repellents of
roasting, boiling, frying, and broiling;&mdash;moreover, the author has
submitted to a labour no preceding cookery-book-maker, perhaps, ever
attempted to encounter,&mdash;having <i>eaten</i> each receipt before he set it
down in his book.</p>

<p>They have all been heartily welcomed by a sufficiently well-educated
palate, and a rather fastidious stomach:&mdash;perhaps this certificate of
the reception of the respective preparations, will partly apologize for
the book containing a smaller number of them than preceding writers on
this gratifying subject have transcribed&mdash;for the amusement of &#8220;every
man&#8217;s master,&#8221; the <span class="smrom">STOMACH</span>.<a name="FNanchor_15-1_2" id="FNanchor_15-1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_15-1_2" class="fnanchor">15-*</a></p>

<p>Numerous as are the receipts in former books, they vary little from each
other, except in the name given to them; the processes of cookery are
very few: I have endeavoured to describe each, in so plain and
circumstantial a manner, as I hope will be easily understood, even by
the amateur, who is unacquainted with the practical part of culinary
concerns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old housekeepers</span> may think I have been tediously minute on many points
which may appear trifling: my predecessors seem to have considered the
<span class="smrom">RUDIMENTS</span> of <span class="smrom">COOKERY</span> quite unworthy of attention. These little delicate
distinctions constitute all the difference between a common and an
elegant table, and are not trifles to the <span class="smrom">YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS</span> who must
learn them either from the communication of others or blunder on till
their own slowly accumulating and dear-bought experience teaches them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>A wish to save time, trouble and money to inexperienced housekeepers and
cooks, and to bring the enjoyments and indulgences of the opulent within
reach of the middle ranks of society, were my motives for publishing
this book. I could accomplish it only by supposing the reader (when he
first opens it) to be as ignorant of cookery as I was, when I first
thought of writing on the subject.</p>

<p>I have done my best to contribute to the comfort of my fellow-creatures:
by a careful attention to the directions herein given, the most ignorant
may easily learn to prepare food, not only in an agreeable and
wholesome, but in an elegant and economical manner.</p>

<p>This task seems to have been left for me; and I have endeavoured to
collect and communicate, in the clearest and most intelligible manner,
the whole of the heretofore abstruse mysteries of the culinary art,
which are herein, I hope, so plainly developed, that the most
inexperienced student in the occult art of cookery, may work from my
receipts with the utmost facility.</p>

<p>I was perfectly aware of the extreme difficulty of teaching those who
are entirely unacquainted with the subject, and of explaining my ideas
effectually, by mere receipts, to those who never shook hands with a
stewpan.</p>

<p>In my anxiety to be readily understood, I have been under the necessity
of occasionally repeating the same directions in different parts of the
book; but I would rather be censured for repetition than for obscurity,
and hope not to be accused of affectation, while my intention is
perspicuity.</p>

<p>Our neighbours of France are so justly famous for their skill in the
affairs of the kitchen, that the adage says, &#8220;As many Frenchmen as many
cooks:&#8221; surrounded as they are by a profusion of the most delicious
wines, and seducing <i>liqueurs</i> offering every temptation to render
drunkenness delightful, yet a tippling Frenchman is a &#8220;<i>rara avis</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>They know how so easily to keep life in sufficient repair by good
eating, that they require little or no screwing up with liquid stimuli.
This accounts for that &#8220;<i>toujours gai</i>,&#8221; and happy equilibrium of the
animal spirits which they enjoy with more regularity than any people:
their elastic stomachs, unimpaired by spirituous liquors, digest
vigorously the food they sagaciously prepare and render easily
assimilable, by cooking it sufficiently,&mdash;wisely contriving to get half
the work of the stomach done by fire and water, till</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;The tender morsels on the palate melt,<br />
And all the force of cookery is felt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cardinal virtues of cookery, &#8220;<span class="smrom">CLEANLINESS, FRUGALITY, NOURISHMENT,
AND <a name="corr4" id="corr4"></a>PALATABLENESS</span>,&#8221; preside over each preparation; for I have not
presumed to insert a single composition, without previously obtaining
the &#8220;<i>imprimatur</i>&#8221; of an enlightened and indefatigable &#8220;<span class="smrom">COMMITTEE OF
TASTE</span>,&#8221; (composed of thorough-bred <span class="smrom">GRANDS GOURMANDS</span> of the first
magnitude,) whose cordial co-operation I cannot too highly praise; and
here do I most gratefully record the unremitting zeal they manifested
during their arduous progress of proving the respective recipes: they
were so truly philosophically and disinterestedly regardless of the wear
and tear of teeth and stomach, that their labour appeared a pleasure to
them. Their laudable perseverance has enabled me to give the
inexperienced amateur an unerring guide how to excite as much pleasure
as possible on the palate, and occasion as little trouble as possible to
the principal viscera, and has hardly been exceeded by those determined
spirits who lately in the Polar expedition braved the other extreme of
temperature, &amp;c. in spite of whales, bears, icebergs, and starvation.</p>

<p>Every attention has been paid in directing the proportions of the
following compositions; not merely to make them inviting to the
appetite, but agreeable and useful to the stomach&mdash;nourishing without
being inflammatory, and savoury without being surfeiting.</p>

<p>I have written for those who make nourishment the chief end of
eating,<a name="FNanchor_17-1_3" id="FNanchor_17-1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_17-1_3" class="fnanchor">17-*</a> and do not desire to provoke appetite beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> the powers
and necessities of nature; proceeding, however, on the purest epicurean
principles of indulging the palate as far as it can be done without
injury or offence to the stomach, and forbidding<a name="FNanchor_18-1_4" id="FNanchor_18-1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_18-1_4" class="fnanchor">18-*</a> nothing but what
is absolutely unfriendly to health.</p>

<p class="poem">&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;That which is not good, is not delicious<br />
To a well-govern&#8217;d and wise appetite.&#8221;&mdash;<a name="corr5" id="corr5"></a><span class="smcap">Milton.</span></p>

<p>This is by no means so difficult a task as some gloomy philosophers
(uninitiated in culinary science) have tried to make the world believe;
who seem to have delighted in persuading you, that every thing that is
nice must be <a name="corr6" id="corr6"></a>noxious, and that every thing that is nasty is wholesome.</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;How charming is divine philosophy?<br />
Not harsh, and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,<br />
But musical as is Apollo&#8217;s lute,<br />
And a perpetual feast of nectar&#8217;d sweets,<br />
Where no crude surfeit reigns.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Milton.</span></p>

<p>Worthy William Shakspeare declared he never found a philosopher who
could endure the toothache patiently:&mdash;the Editor protests that he has
not yet overtaken one who did not love a feast.</p>

<p>Those <i>cynical</i> slaves who are so silly as to suppose it unbecoming a
wise man to indulge in the common comforts of life, should be answered
in the words of the French philosopher. &#8220;Hey&mdash;what, do you philosophers
eat dainties?&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> said a gay Marquess. &#8220;Do you think,&#8221; replied <span class="smcap">Descartes</span>,
&#8220;that God made good things only for fools?&#8221;</p>

<p>Every individual, who is not perfectly imbecile and void of
understanding, is an <i>epicure</i> in his own way. The epicures in boiling
of potatoes are innumerable. The perfection of all enjoyment depends on
the perfection of the faculties of the mind and body; therefore, the
temperate man is the greatest epicure, and the only true voluptuary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The pleasures of the table</span> have been highly appreciated and carefully
cultivated in all countries and in all ages;<a name="FNanchor_19-1_5" id="FNanchor_19-1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_19-1_5" class="fnanchor">19-*</a> and in spite of all
the stoics, every one will allow they are the first and the last we
enjoy, and those we taste the oftenest,&mdash;above a thousand times in a
year, every year of our lives!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The stomach</span> is the mainspring of our system. If it be not sufficiently
wound up to warm the heart and support the circulation, the whole
business of life will, in proportion, be ineffectively performed: we can
neither <i>think</i> with precision, <i>walk</i> with vigour, <i>sit down</i> with
comfort, nor <i>sleep</i> with tranquillity.</p>

<p>There would be no difficulty in proving that it influences (much more
than people in general imagine) all our actions: the destiny of nations
has often depended upon the more or less laborious digestion of a prime
minister.<a name="FNanchor_19-2_6" id="FNanchor_19-2_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_19-2_6" class="fnanchor">19-&#8224;</a> See a very curious anecdote in the memoirs of <span class="smcap">Count
Zinzendorff</span> in Dodsley&#8217;s Annual Register for 1762. 3d edition, p. 32.</p>

<p>The philosopher Pythagoras seems to have been extremely nice in eating;
among his absolute injunctions to his disciples, he commands them to
&#8220;abstain from beans.&#8221;</p>

<p>This ancient sage has been imitated by the learned who have discoursed
on this subject since, who are liberal of their negative, and niggardly
of their positive precepts&mdash;in the ratio, that it is easier to tell you
not to do this, than to teach you how to do that.</p>

<p>Our great English moralist Dr. S. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, his biographer Boswell tells
us, &#8220;was a man of very nice discernment in the science of cookery,&#8221; and
talked of good eating with uncommon satisfaction. &#8220;Some people,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;have a foolish way of not minding, or pretending not to mind, what
they eat; for my part, I mind my belly very studiously and very
carefully, and I look upon it that he who does not mind his belly, will
hardly mind any thing else.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>The Dr. might have said, <i>cannot</i> mind any thing else. The energy of our
<span class="smrom">BRAINS</span> is sadly dependent on the behaviour of our <span class="smrom">BOWELS</span>.<a name="FNanchor_20-1_7" id="FNanchor_20-1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_20-1_7" class="fnanchor">20-*</a> Those
who say, &#8217;Tis no matter what we eat or what we drink, may as well say,
&#8217;Tis no matter whether we eat, or whether we drink.</p>

<p>The following anecdotes I copy from Boswell&#8217;s life of Johnson.</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i>&mdash;&#8220;I could write a better book of cookery than has ever yet
been written; it should be a book on philosophical principles. I would
tell what is the best butcher&#8217;s meat, the proper seasons of different
vegetables, and then, how to roast, and boil, and to compound.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Dilly.</i>&mdash;&#8220;<i>Mrs. Glasse&#8217;s cookery</i>, which is the best, was written by
Dr. Hill.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i>&mdash;&#8220;Well, Sir&mdash;this shows how much better the subject of
cookery<a name="FNanchor_20-2_8" id="FNanchor_20-2_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_20-2_8" class="fnanchor">20-&#8224;</a> may be treated by a philosopher;<a name="FNanchor_20-3_9" id="FNanchor_20-3_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_20-3_9" class="fnanchor">20-&#8225;</a> but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> you shall see
what a book of cookery I shall make, and shall agree with Mr. Dilly for
the copyright.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Miss Seward.</i>&mdash;&#8220;That would be Hercules with the distaff indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i>&mdash;&#8220;No, madam; women can spin very well, but they cannot make a
good book of cookery.&#8221; See vol. iii. p. 311.</p>

<p>Mr. B. adds, &#8220;I never knew a man who relished good eating more than he
did: when at table, he was totally absorbed in the business of the
moment: nor would he, unless in very high company, say one word, or even
pay the least attention to what was said by others, until he had
satisfied his appetite.&#8221;</p>

<p>The peculiarities of his constitution were as great as those of his
character: luxury and intemperance are relative terms, depending on
other circumstances than mere quantity and quality. Nature gave him an
excellent palate, and a craving appetite, and his intense application
rendered large supplies of nourishment absolutely necessary to recruit
his exhausted spirits.</p>

<p>The fact is, this great man had found out that animal and intellectual
vigour,<a name="FNanchor_21-1_10" id="FNanchor_21-1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_21-1_10" class="fnanchor">21-*</a> are much more entirely dependent upon each other than is
commonly understood; especially in those constitutions whose digestive
and chylopoietic organs are capricious and easily put out of tune, or
absorb the &#8220;<i>pabulum vit&aelig;</i>&#8221; indolently and imperfectly: with such, it is
only now and then that the &#8220;<i>sensorium commune</i>&#8221; vibrates with the full
tone of accurately considerative, or creative energy. &#8220;His favourite
dainties were, a leg of pork boiled till it dropped from the bone, a
veal-pie, with plums and sugar, or the outside cut of a salt buttock of
beef. With regard to <i>drink</i>, his liking was for the strongest, as it
was not the <i>flavour</i>, but the <i>effect</i> that he desired.&#8221; Mr. Smale&#8217;s
Account of Dr. Johnson&#8217;s Journey into Wales, 1816, p. 174.</p>

<p>Thus does the <span class="smrom">HEALTH</span> always, and very often the <span class="smrom">LIFE</span> of invalids, and
those who have weak and infirm <span class="smrom">STOMACHS</span>, depend upon the care and skill
of the <span class="smrom">COOK</span>. Our forefathers were so sensible of this, that in days of
yore no man of consequence thought of making a day&#8217;s journey without
taking his &#8220;<span class="smcap">Magister Coquorum</span>&#8221; with him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>The rarity of this talent in a high degree is so well understood, that
besides very considerable pecuniary compensation, his majesty&#8217;s first
and second cooks<a name="FNanchor_22-1_11" id="FNanchor_22-1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_22-1_11" class="fnanchor">22-*</a> are now esquires by their office. We have every
reason to suppose they were persons of equal dignity heretofore.</p>

<p>In Dr. Pegge&#8217;s &#8220;Forme of Cury,&#8221; 8vo. London, 1780, we read, that when
Cardinal Otto, the Pope&#8217;s legate, was at Oxford, A. D. 1248, his brother
officiated as &#8220;<span class="smcap">Magister Coquin&aelig;</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>This important post has always been held as a situation of high trust
and confidence; and the &#8220;<span class="smcap">Magnus Coquus</span>,&#8221; Anglic&egrave;, the <i>Master
Kitchener</i>, has, time immemorial, been an officer of considerable
dignity in the palaces of princes.</p>

<p>The cook in <span class="smcap">Plautus</span> (<i>pseudol</i>) is called &#8220;<i>Hominum servatorem</i>,&#8221; the
preserver of mankind; and by <span class="smcap">Mercier</span> &#8220;<i>un m&eacute;decin qui gu&eacute;rit
radicalement deux maladies mortelles, la faim et la soif</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Norman conqueror <span class="smcap">William</span> bestowed several portions of land on these
highly-favoured domestics, the &#8220;<span class="smcap">Coquorum Pr&aelig;positus</span>,&#8221; and &#8220;<span class="smcap">Coquus
Regius</span>;&#8221; a manor was bestowed on Robert Argyllon the &#8220;<span class="smcap">Grand Queux</span>,&#8221; to
be held by the following service. See that venerable record, the
doomsday book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert Argyllon holdeth one carucate of land in Addington in the county
of Surrey, by the service of making one mess in an earthen pot in the
kitchen of our Lord the <span class="smcap">King</span>, on the day of his coronation, called <i>De
la Groute</i>,&#8221; i. e. a kind of plum-porridge, or water-gruel with plums in
it. This dish is still served up at the royal table at coronations, by
the Lord of the said manor of Addington.</p>

<p>At the coronation of King George IV., Court of Claims, July 12, 1820:</p>

<p>&#8220;The petition of the Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>, which was presented by
Sir G. Nayler, claiming to perform the service of presenting a dish of
<i>De la Groute</i> to the King at the banquet, was considered by the Court,
and decided to be allowed.&#8221;</p>

<p>A good dinner is one of the greatest enjoyments of human life; and as
the practice of cookery is attended with so many discouraging
difficulties,<a name="FNanchor_22-2_12" id="FNanchor_22-2_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_22-2_12" class="fnanchor">22-&#8224;</a> so many disgusting and disagree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>able circumstances,
and even dangers, we ought to have some regard for those who encounter
them to procure us pleasure, and to reward their attention by rendering
their situation every way as comfortable and agreeable as we can. He who
preaches <i>integrity</i> to those in the kitchen, (see &#8220;<i><a href="#FRIENDLY_ADVICE_TO_COOKS">Advice to Cooks</a></i>,&#8221;)
may be permitted to recommend <i>liberality</i> to those in the parlour; they
are indeed the sources of each other. Depend upon it, &#8220;True self-love
and social are the same;&#8221; &#8220;Do as you would be done by:&#8221; give those you
are obliged to trust every inducement to be honest, and no temptation to
play tricks.</p>

<p>When you consider that a good servant eats<a name="FNanchor_23-1_13" id="FNanchor_23-1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_23-1_13" class="fnanchor">23-*</a> no more than a bad one,
how much waste is occasioned by provisions being dressed in a slovenly
and unskilful manner, and how much a good cook (to whom the conduct of
the kitchen is confided) can save you by careful management, no
housekeeper will hardly deem it an unwise speculation (it is certainly
an amiable experiment), to invite the <i>honesty</i> and <i>industry</i> of
domestics, by setting them an example of <i>liberality</i>&mdash;at least, show
them, that &#8220;According to their pains will be their gains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Avoid all approaches towards <i>familiarity</i>; which, to a proverb, is
accompanied by <i>contempt</i>, and soon breaks the neck of obedience.</p>

<p>A lady gave us the following account of the progress of a favourite.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first year, she was an excellent servant; the second, a kind
mistress; the third, an intolerable tyrant; at whose dismissal, every
creature about my house rejoiced heartily.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, servants are more likely to be praised into good conduct, than
scolded out of bad. Always commend them when they do right. To cherish
the desire of pleasing in them, you must show them that you are
pleased:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Be to their faults a little blind,<br />
And to their virtues very kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>By such conduct, ordinary servants may be converted into good ones: few
are so hardened, as not to feel gratified when they are kindly and
liberally treated.</p>

<p>It is a good maxim to select servants not younger than <span class="smrom">THIRTY</span>:&mdash;<i>before</i>
that age, however comfortable you may endeavour to make them, their want
of experience, and the <i>hope</i> of something still <i>better</i>, prevents
their being satisfied with their present state; <i>after</i>, they have had
the benefit of experience: if they are tolerably comfortable, they will
endeavour to deserve the smiles of even a moderately kind master, for
<i>fear</i> they may change for the <i>worse</i>.</p>

<p>Life may indeed be very fairly divided into the seasons of <span class="smrom">HOPE</span> and
<span class="smrom">FEAR</span>. In <span class="smrom">YOUTH</span>, <i>we hope every thing may be right</i>: in <span class="smrom">AGE</span>, <i>we fear
every thing will be wrong</i>.</p>

<p>Do not discharge a good servant for a slight offence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Bear and forbear, thus preached the stoic sages,<br />
And in two words, include the sense of pages.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Human nature is the same in all stations</span>: if you can convince your
servants that you have a generous and considerate regard for their
health and comfort, why should you imagine that they will be insensible
to the good they receive?</p>

<p>Impose no commands but what are reasonable, nor reprove but with justice
and temper: the best way to ensure which is, never to lecture them till
at least one day after they have offended you.</p>

<p>If they have any particular hardship to endure in your service, let them
see that you are concerned for the necessity of imposing it.</p>

<p><i>If they are sick</i>, remember you are their patron as well as their
master: remit their labour, and give them all the assistance of food,
physic, and every comfort in your power. Tender assiduity about an
invalid is half a cure; it is a balsam to the mind, which has a most
powerful effect on the body, soothes the sharpest pains, and strengthens
beyond the richest cordial.</p>

<p>Ye who think that to protect and encourage virtue is the best preventive
from vice, reward your female servants liberally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity should begin at home.</span> Prevention is preferable to cure&mdash;but I
have no objection to see your names ornamenting the lists of subscribers
to foundling hospitals and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> female penitentiaries.<a name="FNanchor_25-1_14" id="FNanchor_25-1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_25-1_14" class="fnanchor">25-*</a> Gentle reader,
for a definition of the word &#8220;<i>charity</i>,&#8221; let me refer you to the 13th
Chapter of St. Paul&#8217;s First Epistle to the Corinthians.</p>

<p>&#8220;To say nothing of the deleterious vapours and pestilential exhalations
of the charcoal, which soon undermine the health of the heartiest, the
glare of a scorching fire, and the smoke so baneful to the eyes and the
complexion, are continual and inevitable dangers: and a cook must live
in the midst of them, as a soldier on the field of battle surrounded by
bullets, and bombs, and <span class="smcap">Congreve&#8217;s</span> rockets; with this only difference,
that for the first, every day is a fighting day, that her warfare is
almost always without glory, and most praiseworthy achievements pass not
only without reward, but frequently without thanks: for the most
consummate cook is, alas! seldom noticed by the master, or heard of by
the guests; who, while they are eagerly devouring his turtle, and
drinking his wine, care very little who dressed the one, or sent the
other.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Almanach des Gourmands.</i></p>

<p>This observation applies especially to the <span class="smrom">SECOND COOK</span>, or first kitchen
maid, in large families, who have by far the hardest place in the house,
and are worse paid, and truly verify the old adage, &#8220;the more work, the
less wages.&#8221; If there is any thing right, the cook has the praise&mdash;when
there is any thing wrong, as surely the <i>kitchen maid</i> has the blame. Be
it known, then, to honest <span class="smcap">John Bull</span>, that this humble domestic is
expected by the cook to take the entire management of all <span class="smrom">ROASTS</span>, <span class="smrom">BOILS</span>,
<span class="smrom">FISH</span>, and <span class="smrom">VEGETABLES</span>; i. e. the principal part of an Englishman&#8217;s
dinner.</p>

<p>The master, who wishes to enjoy the rare luxury of a table regularly
well served in the best style, must treat his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> cook as his friend&mdash;watch
over her health<a name="FNanchor_26-1_15" id="FNanchor_26-1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_26-1_15" class="fnanchor">26-*</a> with the tenderest care, and especially be sure
her taste does not suffer from her stomach being deranged by bilious
attacks.</p>

<p>Besides understanding the management of the spit, the stewpan, and the
rolling-pin, a <span class="smrom">COMPLETE COOK</span> must know how to go to market, write
legibly, and keep accounts accurately.</p>

<p>In well-regulated private families the most convenient custom seems to
be, that the cook keep a house-book, containing an account of the
miscellaneous articles she purchases; and the butcher&#8217;s, baker&#8217;s,
butterman&#8217;s, green-grocer&#8217;s, fishmonger&#8217;s, milkman&#8217;s, and washing bills
are brought in every Monday; these it is the duty of the cook to
examine, before she presents them to her employer every Tuesday morning
to be discharged.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>The advantage of paying such bills weekly is incalculable: among others
the constant check it affords against any excess beyond the sum allotted
for defraying them, and the opportunity it gives of correcting increase
of expense in one week by a prudent retrenchment in the next. &#8220;If you
would live <i>even</i> with the world, calculate your expenses at <i>half</i> your
income&mdash;if you would grow <i>rich</i>, at <i>one-third</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is an excellent plan to have a table of rules for regulating the
ordinary expenses of the family, in order to check any innovation or
excess which otherwise might be introduced unawares, and derange the
proposed distribution of the annual revenue.</p>

<p>To understand the economy of household affairs is not only essential to
a woman&#8217;s proper and pleasant performance of the duties of a wife and a
mother, but is indispensable to the comfort, respectability, and general
welfare of all families, whatever be their circumstances.</p>

<p>The editor has employed some leisure hours in collecting practical hints
for instructing inexperienced housekeepers in the useful</p>

<p class="titlepage"><i>Art of providing comfortably for a family;</i></p>

<p class="noindent">which is displayed so plainly and so particularly, that a young lady may
learn the delectable arcana of domestic affairs, in as little time as is
usually devoted to directing the position of her hands on a
<i>piano-forte</i>, or of her feet in a <i>quadrille</i>&mdash;this will enable her to
make the cage of matrimony as comfortable as the net of courtship was
charming. For this purpose he has contrived a Housekeeper&#8217;s Leger, a
plain and easy plan of keeping accurate accounts of the expenses of
housekeeping, which, with only one hour&#8217;s attention in a week, will
enable you to balance all such accounts with the utmost exactness; an
acceptable acquisition to all who admit that order and economy are the
basis of comfort and independence.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible for a cook in a large family, to attend to the
business of the kitchen with any certainty of perfection, if employed in
other household concerns. It is a service of such importance, and so
difficult to perform even tolerably well, that it is sufficient to
engross the entire attention of one person.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we take a review of the qualifications which are indispensable in
that highly estimable domestic, a <span class="smrom">GOOD COOK</span>, we shall find that very few
deserve that name.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_27-1_16" id="FNanchor_27-1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_27-1_16" class="fnanchor">27-*</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The majority of those who set up for professors of this art are of mean
ability, selfish, and pilfering every thing they can; others are
indolent and insolent. Those who really understand their business (which
are by far the smallest number), are too often either ridiculously
saucy, or insatiably thirsty; in a word, a good subject of this class is
a <i>rara avis</i> indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God sends meat,&#8221;&mdash;who sends cooks?<a name="FNanchor_28-1_17" id="FNanchor_28-1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_28-1_17" class="fnanchor">28-*</a> the proverb has long saved us
the trouble of guessing. Vide <i>Almanach des Gourmands</i>, p. 83.</p>

<p>Of what value then is not this book, which will render every person of
common sense a good cook in as little time as it can be read through
attentively!</p>

<p>If the masters and mistresses of families will sometimes condescend to
make an amusement of this art, they will escape numberless
disappointments, &amp;c. which those who will not, must occasionally
inevitably suffer, to the detriment of both their health and their
fortune.</p>

<p>I did not presume to offer any observations of my own, till I had read
all that I could find written on the subject, and submitted (with no
small pains) to a patient and attentive consideration of every preceding
work, relating to culinary concerns, that I could meet with.</p>

<p>These books vary very little from each other; except in the preface,
they are</p>

<p class="titlepage" >&#8220;Like in all else as one egg to another.&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">&#8220;<i>Ab uno, disce omnes</i>,&#8221; cutting and pasting have been much oftener
employed than the pen and ink: any one who has occasion to refer to two
or three of them, will find the receipts almost always &#8220;<i>verbatim et
literatim</i>;&#8221; equally unintelligible to those who are ignorant, and
useless to those who are acquainted with the business of the kitchen.</p>

<p>I have perused not fewer than 250 of these volumes.</p>

<p>During the Herculean labour of my tedious progress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> through these books,
few of which afford the germ of a single idea, I have often wished that
the authors of them had been satisfied with giving us the results of
their own practice and experience, instead of idly perpetuating the
errors, prejudices, and plagiarisms of their predecessors; the strange,
and unaccountable, and uselessly extravagant farragoes and heterogeneous
compositions which fill their pages, are combinations no rational being
would ever think of either dressing or eating; and without ascertaining
the practicability of preparing the receipts, and their fitness for food
when done, they should never have ventured to recommend them to others:
the reader of them will often put the same <i>qu&aelig;re</i>, as <i>Jeremy</i>, in
Congreve&#8217;s comedy of &#8220;<i>Love for Love</i>,&#8221; when <i>Valentine</i> observes,
&#8220;There&#8217;s a page doubled down in Epictetus that is a feast for an
emperor.&mdash;<i>Jer.</i> Was Epictetus a real cook, or did he only write
receipts?&#8221;</p>

<p>Half of the modern cookery books are made up with pages cut out of
obsolete works, such as the &#8220;Choice Manual of Secrets,&#8221; the &#8220;True
Gentlewoman&#8217;s Delight,&#8221; &amp;c. of as much use, in this age of refinement,
as the following curious passage from &#8220;The Accomplished Lady&#8217;s Rich
Closet of Rarities, or Ingenious Gentlewoman&#8217;s Delightful Companion,&#8221;
12mo. London, 1653, chapter 7, page 42; which I have inserted in a
note,<a name="FNanchor_29-1_18" id="FNanchor_29-1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_29-1_18" class="fnanchor">29-*</a> to give the reader a notion of the barbarous manners of the
16th century, with the addition of the arts of the confectioner, the
brewer, the baker, the distiller, the gardener, the clear-starcher, and
the perfumer, and how to make pickles, puff paste, butter, blacking, &amp;c.
together with my <i>Lady Bountiful&#8217;s</i> sovereign remedy for an inward
bruise, and other ever-failing nostrums,&mdash;<i>Dr. Killemquick&#8217;s</i>
wonder-working essence, and fallible elixir, which cures all manner of
incurable maladies directly minute, <i>Mrs. Notable&#8217;s</i> instructions how to

&#8220;than Dobbin, thy thill-horse, hath upon his tail,&#8221; and many others
equally invaluable!!!&mdash;the proper appellation for which would be &#8220;a
dangerous budget of vulgar errors,&#8221; concluding with a bundle of extracts
from &#8220;the Gardener&#8217;s Calendar,&#8221; and &#8220;the Publican&#8217;s Daily Companion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thomas Carter, in the preface to his &#8220;City and Country Cook,&#8221; London,
1738, says, &#8220;What I have published is almost the only book, one or two
excepted, which of late years has come into the world, that has been the
result of the author&#8217;s own practice and experience; for though very few
eminent practical cooks have ever cared to publish what they knew of the
art, yet they have been prevailed on, for a small premium from a
bookseller, to lend their names to performances in this art unworthy
their owning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert May, in the introduction to his &#8220;Accomplished Cook,&#8221; 1665, says,
&#8220;To all honest and well-intending persons of my profession, and others,
this book cannot but be acceptable, as it plainly and profitably
discovers the mystery of the whole art; for which, though I may be
envied by some, that only value their private interests above posterity
and the public good; yet (he adds), God and my own conscience would not
permit me to bury these, my experiences, with my silver hairs in the
grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those high and mighty masters and mistresses of the alimentary art, who
call themselves &#8220;<i>profess</i>&#8221; cooks, are said to be very jealous and
mysterious beings; and that if, in a long life of laborious stove-work,
they have found out a few useful secrets, they seldom impart to the
public the fruits of their experience; but sooner than divulge their
discoveries for the benefit and comfort of their fellow-creatures, these
silly, selfish beings will rather run the risk of a reprimand from their
employers, and will sooner spoil a good dinner, than suffer their
fellow-servants to see how they dress it!!!</p>

<p>The silly selfishness of short-sighted mortals, is never more extremely
absurd than in their unprofitable parsimony of what is of no use to
them, but would be of actual value to others, who, in return, would
willingly repay them tenfold. However, I hope I may be permitted to
quote, in defence of these culinary professors, a couple of lines of a
favourite old song:</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;If you search the world round, each profession, you&#8217;ll find,<br />
Hath some snug little secrets, which the Mystery<a name="FNanchor_30-1_19" id="FNanchor_30-1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_30-1_19" class="fnanchor">30-*</a> they call.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My receipts</span> are the results of experiments carefully made, and
accurately and circumstantially related;</p>

<p>The <span class="smrom">TIME</span> requisite for dressing being stated;</p>

<p>The <span class="smrom">QUANTITIES</span> of the various articles contained in each composition
being carefully set down in <span class="smrom">NUMBER</span>, <span class="smrom">WEIGHT</span>, and <span class="smrom">MEASURE</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smrom">WEIGHTS</span> are <i>avoirdupois</i>; the <span class="smrom">MEASURE</span>, <i>Lyne&#8217;s</i> graduated glass, i.
e. a wine-pint divided into sixteen ounces, and the ounce into eight
drachms. By a <i>wine-glass</i> is to be understood two ounces liquid
measure; by a large or <i>table-spoonful</i>, half an ounce; by a small or
<i>tea-spoonful</i>, a drachm, or half a quarter of an ounce, i. e. nearly
equal to two drachms avoirdupois.</p>

<p>At some glass warehouses, you may get measures divided into tea and
table-spoons. No cook should be without one, who wishes to be regular in
her business.</p>

<p>This precision has never before been attempted in cookery books, but I
found it indispensable from the impossibility of <i>guessing</i> the
quantities intended by such obscure expressions as have been usually
employed for this purpose in former works:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="corr7" id="corr7"></a>For instance: a bit of this&mdash;a handful of that&mdash;a pinch of t&#8217;other&mdash;do
&#8217;em over with an egg&mdash;and a sprinkle of salt&mdash;a dust of flour&mdash;a shake
of pepper&mdash;a squeeze of lemon,&mdash;or a dash of vinegar, &amp;c. are the
constant phrases. Season it to your palate, (meaning the cook&#8217;s,) is
another form of speech: now, if she has any, (it is very unlikely that
it is in unison with that of her employers,) by continually sipping
<i>piquante</i> relishes, it becomes blunted and insensible, and loses the
faculty of appreciating delicate flavours, so that every thing is done
at random.</p>

<p>These culinary technicals are so very differently understood by the
learned who write them, and the unlearned who read them, and their
&#8220;<i>rule of thumb</i>&#8221; is so extremely indefi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>nite, that if the same dish be
dressed by different persons, it will generally be so different, that
nobody would imagine they had worked from the same directions, which
will assist a person who has not served a regular apprenticeship in the
kitchen, no more than reading &#8220;Robinson Crusoe&#8221; would enable a sailor to
steer safely from England to India.<a name="FNanchor_32-1_20" id="FNanchor_32-1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_32-1_20" class="fnanchor">32-*</a></p>

<p>It is astonishing how cheap <i>cookery books</i> are held by practical cooks:
when I applied to an experienced artist to recommend me some books that
would give me a notion of the rudiments of cookery, he replied, with a
smile, &#8220;You may read <i>Don Quixote</i>, or <i>Peregrine Pickle</i>, they are both
very good books.&#8221;</p>

<p>Careless expressions in cookery are the more surprising, as the
confectioner is regularly attentive, in the description of his
preparations, to give the exact quantities, though his business,
compared to cookery, is as unimportant as the ornamental is inferior to
the useful.</p>

<p>The maker of blanc-mange, custards, &amp;c. and the endless and useless
collection of puerile playthings for the palate (of first and second
childhood, for the vigour of manhood seeketh not to be sucking sugar, or
sipping turtle), is scrupulously exact, even to a grain, in his
ingredients; while cooks are unintelligibly indefinite, although they
are intrusted with the administration of our <span class="smrom">FOOD</span>, upon the proper
quality and preparation of which, all our powers of body and mind
depend; their energy being invariably in the ratio of the performance of
the restorative process, i. e. the quantity, quality, and perfect
digestion of what we eat and drink.</p>

<p>Unless <i>the stomach</i> be in good humour, every part of the machinery of
<i>life</i> must vibrate with languor: can we then be too attentive to its
adjustment?!!</p>

<p>But the most extraordinary of all the culinary receipts that have
been under my eye, is the following diabolically cruel directions
of Mizald, &#8220;<i>how to roast and eat a goose alive</i>.&#8221; &#8220;Take a <span class="smrom">GOOSE</span> or
a <span class="smrom">DUCK</span>, or some such <i>lively creature</i>, (but a goose is best of all
for this purpose,) pull off all her feathers, only the head and
neck must be spared: then make a fire round about her, not too
close to her, that the smoke do not choke her, and that the fire
may not burn her too soon; nor too far off, that she may not escape
free: within the circle of the fire let there be set small cups and
pots full of water, wherein salt and honey are mingled: and let
there be set also chargers full of sodden apples, cut into small
pieces in the dish. The goose must be all larded, and basted over
with butter, to make her the more fit to be eaten, and may roast
the better: put then fire about her, but do not make too much
haste, when as you see her begin to roast; for by walking about,
and flying here and there, being cooped in by the fire that stops
her way out, the unwearied goose is kept in; she will fall to drink
the water to quench her thirst and cool her heart, and all her
body, and the apple-sauce will make her dung, and cleanse and empty
her. And when she roasteth, and consumes inwardly, always wet her
head and heart with a wet sponge; and when you see her giddy with
running, and begin to stumble, her heart wants moisture, and she is
roasted enough. Take her up, set her before your guests, and she
will cry as you cut off any part from her, and will be almost eaten
up before she be dead; it is mighty pleasant to behold!!&#8221;&mdash;See

<p>&#8220;We suppose Mr. Mizald stole this receipt from the kitchen of his

<p>Many articles were in vogue in the 14th century, which are now
obsolete. We add the following specimens of the <span class="smrom">CULINARY AFFAIRS OF
DAYS OF YORE</span>.</p>

<p class="titlepage"><i>Sauce for a goose, A.D. 1381.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Take a faire panne, and set hit under the goose whill she rostes;

<p>&#8220;That unwieldy marine animal the <span class="smrom">PORPUS</span> was dressed in a variety of
modes, salted, roasted, stewed, &amp;c. Our ancestors were not singular
in their partiality to it; I find, from an ingenious friend of
mine, that it is even now, A. D. 1790, sold in the markets of most
towns in Portugal; the flesh of it is intolerably hard and
rancid.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warner&#8217;s</span> <i>Antiq. Cul.</i> 4to. p. 15.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <span class="smrom">SWAN</span><a name="FNanchor_33-2_22" id="FNanchor_33-2_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_33-2_22" class="fnanchor">33-&#8224;</a> was also a dish of state, and in high fashion when
the elegance of<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 91%;"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> the feast was estimated by the magnitude of the
articles of which it was composed; the number consumed at the Earl
of Northumberland&#8217;s table, A. D. 1512, amounted to
twenty.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Northumberland Household-book</i>, p. 108.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <span class="smrom">CRANE</span> was a darling dainty in <i>William the Conqueror&#8217;s</i> time,
and so partial was that monarch to it, that when his prime
favourite, William Fitz-Osborne, the steward of the household,
served him with a crane scarcely half roasted, the king was so
highly exasperated, that he lifted up his fist, and would have
strucken him, had not <i>Eudo</i> (appointed <i>Dapifer</i> immediately
after) warded off the blow.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warner&#8217;s</span> <i>Antiq. Cul.</i> p. 12.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seals, curlews, herons, bitterns</span>, and the <span class="smrom">PEACOCK</span>, that noble bird,
&#8220;the food of lovers and the meat of lords,&#8221; were also at this time
in high fashion, when the baronial entertainments were
characterized by a grandeur and pompous ceremonial, approaching
nearly to the magnificence of royalty; there was scarcely any royal
or noble feast without <span class="smrom">PECOKKES</span>, which were stuffed with spices and
sweet herbs, roasted and served up whole, and covered after
dressing with the skin and feathers; the beak and comb gilt, and
the tail spread, and some, instead of the feathers, covered it with
leaf gold; it was a common dish on grand occasions, and continued
to adorn the English table till the beginning of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>In Massinger&#8217;s play of &#8220;The City Madam,&#8221; Holdfast, exclaiming
against city luxury, says, &#8220;three fat wethers bruised, to make
sauce for a single peacock.&#8221;</p>

<p>This bird is one of those luxuries which were often sought, because
they were seldom found: its scarcity and external appearance are
its only recommendation; the meat of it is tough and tasteless.</p>

<p>Another favourite dish at the tables of our forefathers, was a <span class="smrom">PIE</span>
of stupendous magnitude, out of which, on its being opened, a flock
of living birds flew forth, to the no small surprise and amusement
of the guests.</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie;<br />
When the pie was open&#8217;d, the birds began to sing&mdash;<br />
Oh! what a dainty dish&mdash;&#8217;t is fit for any king.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a common joke at an old English feast. These <i>animated</i>
pies were often introduced &#8220;to set on,&#8221; as Hamlet says, &#8220;a quantity
of barren spectators to laugh;&#8221; there is an instance of a dwarf
undergoing such an <i>incrustation</i>. About the year 1630, king
Charles and his queen were entertained by the duke and dutchess of
Buckingham, at Burleigh on the Hill, on which occasion <span class="smcap">Jeffery
Hudson</span>, <i>the dwarf</i>, was served up in a cold pie.&mdash;See <span class="smcap">Walpole&#8217;s</span>
<i>Anecdotes of Painting</i>, vol. ii. p. 14.</p>

<p>The <span class="smrom">BARON OF BEEF</span> was another favourite and substantial support of
old English hospitality.</p>

<p>Among the most polished nations of the 15th and 16th centuries, the
<i>powdered</i> (salted) <i>horse</i>, seems to have been a dish in some
esteem: <i>Grimalkin</i> herself could not escape the undistinguishing
fury of the cook. Don Anthony of Guevera, the chronicler to Charles
V., gives the following account of a feast at which he was present.
&#8220;I will tell you no lye, I sawe such kindes of meates eaten, as are
wont to be sene, but not eaten&mdash;<i>as a</i> <span class="smrom">HORSE</span> <i>roasted</i>&mdash;a <span class="smrom">CAT</span> <i>in
gely</i>&mdash;<span class="smrom">LYZARDS</span> in hot brothe, <span class="smrom">FROGGES</span> fried,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>While we are thus considering the curious dishes of olden times, we
will cursorily mention the <i>singular diet</i> of two or three nations
of antiquity, noticed by <i>Herodotus</i>, lib. iv. &#8220;The <i>Androphagi</i>
(the cannibals of the ancient world) greedily devoured the
carcasses of their fellow-creatures; while the inoffensive <i>Cabri</i>
(a Scythian tribe) found both food and drink in the agreeable nut
of the Pontic tree. The <i>Lotophagi</i> lived entirely on the fruit of
the <i>Lotus tree</i>. The savage <i>Troglodyte</i> esteemed a <i>living
serpent</i> the most delicate of all morsels; while the capricious
palate of the <i>Zyguntini</i> preferred the <i>ape</i> to every
thing.&#8221;&mdash;Vide <span class="smcap">Warner&#8217;s</span> <i>Antiq. Cul.</i> p. 135.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Romans, in the luxurious period of their empire, took five
meals a day; a breakfast (<i>jentaculum</i>;) a dinner, which was a
light meal without any formal preparation (<i>prandium</i>); a kind of
<i>tea</i>, as we should call it, between dinner and supper (<i>merenda</i>);
a supper (<i>c&aelig;na</i>), which was their great meal, and commonly
consisted of two courses; the first of meats, the second, what we
call a dessert; and a posset,<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 91%;"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> or something delicious after supper
(<i>commissatio</i>).&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Adam&#8217;s</span> <i>Rom. Antiq.</i> 2d edition, 8vo. 1792, p.
434 and 447.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Romans usually began their entertainments with eggs, and ended
with fruits; hence, <span class="smcap">Ab ovo usque ad mala</span>, from the beginning to the
end of supper, <i>Horat. Sat.</i> i. 3. 6; <i>Cic. Fam.</i> ix. 20.</p>

Romans, are enumerated, <i>Gell.</i> vii. 16, <i>Macrob. Sat.</i> ii. 9,

<i>ibid.</i> p. 447.</p>

<p>That the English reader may be enabled to form some idea of the
heterogeneous messes with which the Roman palate was delighted, I
introduce the following receipt from <i>Apicius</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Thick sauce for a boiled chicken.</span>&mdash;Put the following ingredients
into a mortar: aniseed, dried mint, and lazar-root (similar to
assaf&oelig;tida), cover them with vinegar; add dates; pour in
liquamen, oil, and a small quantity of mustard seeds; reduce all to
a proper thickness with port wine warmed; and then pour this same
over your chicken, which should previously be boiled in anise-seed
water.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Liquamen</i> and <i>Garum</i> were synonymous terms for the same thing;
the former adopted in the room of the latter, about the age of
<i>Aurelian</i>. It was a liquid, and thus prepared: the <i>guts</i> of large
fish, and a variety of small fish, were put into a vessel and well
salted, and exposed to the sun till they became putrid. A liquor
was produced in a short time, which being strained off, was the
<i>liquamen</i>.&mdash;Vide <span class="smcap">Lister</span> <i>in Apicium</i>, p. 16, notes.</p>

<p><i>Essence of anchovy</i>, as it is usually made for sale, when it has
been opened about ten days, is not much unlike the Roman
<i>liquamen</i>. See <a href="#no_433">No. 433</a>. Some suppose it was the same thing as the
Russian <i>Caviar</i>, which is prepared from the roe of the sturgeon.</p>

<p>The <span class="smrom">BLACK BROTH</span> of <i>Laced&aelig;mon</i> will long continue to excite the
wonder of the philosopher, and the disgust of the epicure. What the
ingredients of this sable composition were, we cannot exactly
ascertain. <i>Jul. Pollux</i> says, the Laced&aelig;monian black broth was
<i>blood</i>, thickened in a certain way: Dr. <span class="smcap">Lister</span> (<i>in Apicium</i>)
supposes it to have been <i>hog&#8217;s blood</i>; if so, this celebrated
Spartan dish bore no very distant resemblance to the
<i>black-puddings</i> of our days. It could not be a very <i>alluring</i>
mess, since a citizen of <i>Sybaris</i> having tasted it, declared it
was no longer a matter of astonishment with him, why the <i>Spartans</i>
were so fearless of death, since any one in his senses would much
rather die, than exist on such execrable food.&mdash;Vide <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
lib. iv. c. 3. When Dionysius the tyrant had tasted the <i>black
broth</i>, he exclaimed against it as miserable stuff; the cook
replied&mdash;&#8220;It was no wonder, for the sauce was wanting.&#8221; &#8220;What
sauce?&#8221; says Dionysius. The answer was,&mdash;&#8220;<i>Labour and exercise,
hunger and thirst, these are the sauces we Laced&aelig;monians use</i>,&#8221; and
they make the coarsest fare agreeable.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cicero</span>, 3 Tuscul.</p></div>

performed by us poor mortals in as easy and simple a manner as it is in
&#8220;<i>the cooking animals in the moon</i>,&#8221; who &#8220;lose no time at their meals;
but open their left side, and place the whole quantity at once in their
stomachs, then shut it, till the same day in the next month, for they
never indulge themselves with food more than twelve times in a
year.&#8221;&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap">Baron Munchausen&#8217;s</span> <i>Travels</i>, p. 188.</p>

<p>Pleasing the palate is the main end in most books of cookery, but <i>it is
my aim to blend the toothsome with the wholesome</i>; but, after all,
however the hale gourmand may at first differ from me in opinion, the
latter is the chief concern; since if he be even so entirely devoted to
the pleasure of eating as to think of no other, still the care of his
health becomes part of that; if he is sick he cannot relish his food.</p>

<p>&#8220;The term <i>gourmand</i>, or <span class="smrom">EPICURE</span>, has been strangely perverted; it has
been conceived synonymous with a glutton, &#8216;<i>n&eacute; pour la digestion</i>,&#8217; who
will eat as long as he can sit, and drink longer than he can stand, nor
leave his cup while he can lift it; or like the great eater of Kent whom
<span class="smcap">Fuller</span> places among his worthies, and tells us that he did eat with ease
<i>thirty dozens of pigeons</i> at one meal; at another, <i>fourscore rabbits</i>
and <i>eighteen yards of black pudding</i>, London measure!&mdash;or a fastidious
appetite, only to be excited by fantastic dainties, as the brains of
<i>peacocks</i> or <i>parrots</i>, the tongues of <i>thrushes</i> or <i>nightingales</i>, or
the teats of a lactiferous <i>sow</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the acceptation which I give to the term <span class="smrom">EPICURE</span>, it means only the
person who has good sense and good taste enough to wish to have his food
cooked according to scientific principles; that is to say, so prepared
that the palate be not offended&mdash;that it be rendered easy of solution in
the stomach, and ultimately contribute to health; exciting him as an
animal to the vigorous enjoyment of those recreations and duties,
physical and intellectual, which constitute the happiness and dignity of
his nature.&#8221; For this illustration I am indebted to my scientific friend
<i>Apicius C&aelig;lius, Jun.</i>, with whose erudite observations several pages of
this work are enriched, to which I have affixed the signature <a name="corr11" id="corr11"></a><i>A. C.,
Jun.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_18-1_4" id="Footnote_18-1_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18-1_4"><span class="label">18-*</span></a> &#8220;Although <span class="smrom">AIR</span> is more immediately necessary to life than
<span class="smrom">FOOD</span>, the knowledge of the latter seems of more importance; it admits
certainly of great variety, and a choice is more frequently in our
power. A very spare and simple diet has commonly been recommended as
most conducive to health; but it would be more beneficial to mankind if
we could show them that a pleasant and varied diet was equally
consistent with health, as the very strict regimen of Arnard, or the
miller of Essex. These, and other abstemious people, who, having
experienced the greatest extremities of bad health, were driven to
temperance as their last resource, may run out in praises of a simple
diet; but the probability is, that nothing but the dread of former
sufferings could have given them the resolution to persevere in so
strict a course of abstinence, which persons who are in health and have
no such apprehension could not be induced to undertake, or, if they did,
would not long continue.</p>

<p>&#8220;In all cases, great allowance must be made for the weakness of human
nature: the desires and appetites of mankind must, to a certain degree,
be gratified, and the man who wishes to be most useful will imitate the
indulgent parent, who, while he endeavours to promote the true interests
of his children, allows them the full enjoyment of all those innocent
pleasures which they take delight in. If it could be pointed out to
mankind that some articles used as food were hurtful, while others were
in their nature innocent, and that the latter were numerous, various,
and pleasant, they might, perhaps, be induced to forego those which were
hurtful, and confine themselves to those which were innocent.&#8221;&mdash;<i>See</i>

<p>&#8220;It is sufficiently manifest how much uncomfortable feelings of the
bowels affect the nervous system, and how immediately and completely the
general disorder is relieved by an alvine evacuation.&#8221;&mdash;p. 53.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot reasonably expect tranquillity of the nervous system, while
there is disorder of the digestive organs. As we can perceive no
permanent source of strength but from the digestion of our food, it

physicians.&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">Kenelme Digby</span>&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">Theodore Mayerne</span>.&mdash;See the last

<p>&#8220;To understand the <span class="smrom">THEORY OF COOKERY</span>, we must attend to the action of
heat upon the various constituents of alimentary substances as applied
directly and indirectly through the medium of some fluid, in the former
way as exemplified.&#8221; In the processes of <span class="smrom">ROASTING</span> and <span class="smrom">BOILING</span>, the chief
constituents of animal substances undergo the following changes&mdash;the
<i>fibrine</i> is corrugated, the <i>albumen</i> coagulated, the <i>gelatine</i> and
<i>osmazome</i> rendered more soluble in water, the <i>fat</i> liquefied, and the
<i>water</i> evaporated.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the heat exceed a certain degree, the surface becomes first brown,
and then scorched. In consequence of these changes, the muscular fibre
becomes opaque, shorter, firmer, and drier; the tendons less opaque,
softer, and gluey; the fat is either melted out, or rendered
semi-transparent. Animal fluids become more transparent: the albumen is
coagulated and separated, and they dissolve gelatine and osmazome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lastly, and what is the most important change, and the immediate object
of all cookery, the meat loses the vapid nauseous smell and taste
peculiar to its raw state, and it becomes savoury and grateful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heat applied through the intervention of boiling oil, or melted fat, as
in <span class="smrom">FRYING</span>, produces nearly the same changes; as the heat is sufficient
to evaporate the water, and to induce a degree of scorching.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when water is the medium through which heat is applied&mdash;as in
<span class="smrom">BOILING</span>, <span class="smrom">STEWING</span>, and <span class="smrom">BAKING</span>, the effects are somewhat different, as the
heat never exceeds 212&deg;, which is not sufficient to commence the process
of browning or decomposition, and the soluble constituents are removed
by being dissolved in the water, forming soup or broth; or, if the
direct contact of the water be prevented, they are dissolved in the
juices of the meat, and separate in the form of gravy.&#8221;</p>

would take servants recommended from the <span class="smcap">Magdalen&mdash;Penitentiary</span>&mdash;or

<p>&#8220;<i>Female servants</i> who pursue an honest course, have to travel, in their
peculiar orbit, through a more powerfully resisting medium than perhaps
any other class of people in civilized life; they should be treated with
something like Christian kindness: for want of this, a fault which might
at the time have been easily amended has become the source of
interminable sorrow.&#8221;</p>

gratuitous registry, and by rewards, was instituted in 1813; plans of
which may be had <i>gratis</i> at the Society&#8217;s House, No. 10, Hatton Garden.
The above is an extract from the <span class="smcap">Rev. H. G. Watkins&#8217;s</span> <i>Hints to Heads of
Families</i>, a work well deserving the attentive consideration of
inexperienced housekeepers.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_26-1_15" id="Footnote_26-1_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26-1_15"><span class="label">26-*</span></a> The greatest care should be taken by the man of fashion,
that his cook&#8217;s health be preserved: one hundredth part of the attention
usually bestowed on his dog, or his horse, will suffice to regulate her
animal system.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cleanliness, and a proper ventilation to carry off smoke and steam,
should be particularly attended to in the construction of a kitchen; the
grand scene of action, the fire-place, should be placed where it may
receive plenty of light; hitherto the contrary has prevailed, and the
poor cook is continually basted with her own perspiration.&#8221;&mdash;<i>A. C.,
Jun.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The most experienced artists in cookery cannot be certain of their work
without tasting: they must be incessantly tasting. The spoon of a good
cook is continually passing from the stewpan to his tongue; nothing but
frequent tasting his sauces, rago&ucirc;ts, &amp;c. can discover to him what
progress they have made, or enable him to season a soup with any
certainty of success; his palate, therefore, must be in the highest
state of excitability, that the least fault may be perceived in an
instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, alas! the constant empyreumatic fumes of the stoves, the necessity
of frequent drinking, and often of bad beer, to moisten a parched
throat; in short, every thing around him conspires quickly to vitiate
the organs of taste; the palate becomes blunted; its quickness of
feeling and delicacy, on which the sensibility of the organs of taste
depends, grows daily more obtuse; and in a short time the gustatory
nerve becomes quite unexcitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">If you find your cook neglect his business</span>&mdash;that his <i>rago&ucirc;ts</i> are too
highly spiced or salted, and his cookery has too much of the &#8216;<i>haut
go&ucirc;t</i>,&#8217; you may be sure that <i>his index of taste</i> wants regulating; his
palate has lost its sensibility, and it is high time to call in the
assistance of the apothecary.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Purger souvent</i>&#8217; is the grand maxim in all kitchens where <i>le Ma&icirc;tre
d&#8217;H&ocirc;tel</i> has any regard for the reputation of his table. <i>Les Bons
Hommes de Bouche</i> submit to the operation without a murmur; to bind
others, it should be made the first condition in hiring them. Those who
refuse, prove they were not born to become masters of their art; and
their indifference to fame will rank them, as they deserve, among those
slaves who pass their lives in as much obscurity as their own stewpans.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the preceding observations from the &#8220;<i>Almanach des Gourmands</i>,&#8221; we
may add, that the <i>Mouthician</i> will have a still better chance of
success, if he can prevail on his master to observe the same <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
which he orders for his cook; or, instead of endeavouring to awaken an
idle appetite by reading the index to a cookery book, or an additional
use of the pepper-box and salt-cellar, rather seek it from abstinence or
exercise;&mdash;the philosophical <i>gourmand</i> will consider that the edge of
our appetite is generally keen, in proportion to the activity of our
other habits; let him attentively peruse our &#8220;<span class="smcap">Peptic Precepts</span>,&#8221; &amp;c.
which briefly explain the art of refreshing the gustatory nerves, and of
invigorating the whole system. See in the following <a href="#INVITATIONS_TO_DINNER">chapter</a> on

acute, that she may be sensible when the contents of her vessels bubble,
although they be closely covered, and that she may be alarmed before the
pot boils over; her auditory nerve ought to discriminate (when several
saucepans are in operation at the same time) the simmering of one, the
ebullition of another, and the full-toned wabbling of a third.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is imperiously requisite that her organ of smell be highly
susceptible of the various effluvia, that her nose may distinguish the
perfection of aromatic ingredients, and that in animal substances it
shall evince a suspicious accuracy between tenderness and putrefaction;
above all, her olfactories should be tremblingly alive to mustiness and
empyreuma.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is from the exquisite sensibility of her palate, that we admire and

venture to eat <i>spoonmeat</i> so hot that the tears stand in your eyes,
which is as unseemly as the <i>gentlewoman</i> who pretended to have as
little a <i>stomach</i> as she had a <i>mouth</i>, and therefore would not swallow
her <i>pease</i> by spoonfuls; but took them one by one, and cut them in two
before she would eat them. It is very uncomely to drink so large a
<i>draught</i> that your <i>breath</i> is almost gone&mdash;and are forced to blow
strongly to recover yourself&mdash;throwing down your <i>liquor</i> as into a

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> &#8220;the affairs of the mouth&#8221; the strictest punctuality is
indispensable; the <span class="smrom">GASTRONOMER</span> ought to be as accurate an observer of
time, as the <span class="smrom">ASTRONOMER</span>. The least delay produces fatal and irreparable
misfortunes.</p>

<p>Almost all other ceremonies and civil duties may be put off for several
hours without much inconvenience, and all may be postponed without
absolute danger. A little delay may try the patience of those who are
waiting; but the act itself will be equally perfect and equally valid.
Procrastination sometimes is rather advantageous than prejudicial. It
gives time for reflection, and may prevent our taking a step which would
have made us miserable for life; the delay of a courier has prevented
the conclusion of a convention, the signing of which might have
occasioned the ruin of a nation.</p>

<p>If, from affairs the most important, we descend to our pleasures and
amusements, we shall find new arguments in support of our assertions.
The putting off of a rendezvous, or a ball, &amp;c. will make them the more
delightful. To <i>hope</i> is to <i>enjoy</i>.</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Man never is, but always to be blest.&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">The anticipation of pleasure warms our imagination, and keeps those
feelings alive, which possession too often extinguishes.</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;&#8217;Tis <i>expectation</i> only makes us blest;<br />
<i>Enjoyment</i> disappoints us at the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson has most sagaciously said; &#8220;Such is the state of life, that
none are happy, but by the anticipation of change: the change itself is
nothing: when we have made it, the next wish is, immediately to change
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>However singular our assertions may have at first appeared to those who
have not considered the subject, we hope by this time we have made
converts of our readers, and convinced the &#8220;<i>Amateurs de Bonne Ch&egrave;re</i>&#8221;
of the truth and importance of our remarks; and that they will remember,
that <span class="smrom">DINNER</span> is the only act of the day which cannot be put off with
impunity, for even <span class="smrom">FIVE MINUTES</span>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>In a well-regulated family, all the clocks and watches should agree; on
this depends the fate of the dinner; what would be agreeable to the
stomach, and restorative to the system, if served at <span class="smrom">FIVE</span> o&#8217;clock, will
be uneatable and innutritive and indigestible at <span class="smrom">A QUARTER PAST</span>.</p>

<p>The dining-room should be furnished with a good-going clock; the space
over the kitchen fire-place with another, vibrating in unison with the
former, so placed, that the cook may keep one eye on the clock, and the
other on the spit, &amp;c. She will calculate to a minute the time required
to roast a large capon or a little lark, and is equally attentive to the
degree of heat of her stove, and the time her sauce remains on it, when
to withdraw the bakings from the oven, the roast from the spit, and the
stew from the pan.</p>

<p>With all our love of punctuality, the first consideration must still be,
that the dinner &#8220;be well done, when &#8217;t is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a common fault with cooks who are anxious about time, to overdress
every thing&mdash;the guests had better wait than the dinner&mdash;a little delay
will improve their appetite; but if the dinner waits for the guests, it
will be deteriorated every minute: the host who wishes to entertain his
friends with food perfectly well dressed, while he most earnestly
endeavours to impress on their minds the importance of being punctual to
the appointed hour, will still allow his cook a quarter of an hour&#8217;s
grace.</p>

<p>The old adage that &#8220;the eye is often bigger than the belly,&#8221; is often
verified by the ridiculous vanity of those who wish to make an
appearance above their fortune. Nothing can be more ruinous to real
comfort than the too common custom of setting out a table, with a parade
and a profusion, unsuited not only to the circumstances of the hosts,
but to the number of the guests; or more fatal to true hospitality, than
the multiplicity of dishes which luxury has made fashionable at the
tables of the great, the wealthy, and the ostentatious, who are, often,
neither great nor wealthy.</p>

<p>Such pompous preparation, instead of being a compliment to our guests,
is nothing better than an indirect offence; it is a tacit insinuation,
that it is absolutely necessary to provide such delicacies to bribe the
depravity of their palates, when we desire the pleasure of their
company; and that society now, must be purchased, at the same price
<span class="smcap">Swift</span> told <span class="smcap">Pope</span> he was obliged to pay for it in Ireland. &#8220;I should
hardly prevail to find one visiter, if I were not able to hire him with
a bottle of wine.&#8221; Vide Swift&#8217;s letters to Pope, July 10th, 1732.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>When twice as much cooking is undertaken as there are servants, or
conveniences in the kitchen to do it properly, dishes must be dressed
long before the dinner hour, and stand by spoiling&mdash;the poor cook loses
her credit, and the poor guests get indigestions. Why prepare for eight
or ten friends, more than sufficient for twenty or thirty visiters?
&#8220;Enough is as good as a feast,&#8221; and a prudent provider, who sensibly
takes measure of the stomachic, instead of the SILLY ocular, appetite of
his guests, may entertain his friends, three times as often, and ten
times as well.</p>

the eye, or pamper palled appetite, that <i>overcome the stomach and

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Indigestion</span> will sometimes overtake the most experienced epicure; when
the gustatory nerves are in good humour, hunger and savoury viands will
sometimes seduce the tongue of a &#8216;<i>grand gourmand</i>&#8217; to betray the
interests of his stomach in spite of his brains.</p>

eructant<a name="FNanchor_38-2_24" id="FNanchor_38-2_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_38-2_24" class="fnanchor">38-&#8224;</a> signals of distress, the <i>peristaltic persuaders</i> are as
agreeable and effectual assistance as can be offered; and for delicate
constitutions, and those that are impaired by age or intemperance, are a
valuable panacea.</p>

<p>&#8220;They derive, and deserve this name, from the peculiar mildness of their
operation. One or two very gently increase the action of the principal
viscera, help them to do their work a little faster, and enable the
stomach to serve with an ejectment whatever offends it, and move it into
the bowels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus <i>indigestion</i> is easily and speedily removed, <i>appetite</i> restored,
the mouths of the absorbing vessels being cleansed, <i>nutrition</i> is
facilitated, and <i>strength</i> of body, and <i>energy</i> of mind, are the happy
results.&#8221; See &#8220;<span class="smcap">Peptic Precepts</span>,&#8221; from which we extract the following
prescription&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>To make <span class="smrom">FORTY PERISTALTIC PERSUADERS</span>,</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>Take</li>
  <li style="font-size: 90%;">&nbsp;</li>
  <li style="font-size: 90%;">Turkey rhubarb, finely pulverized, two drachms,</li>
  <li style="font-size: 90%;">Syrup (by weight), one drachm,</li>
  <li style="font-size: 90%;">Oil of carraway, ten drops (minims),</li>
  <li style="font-size: 90%;">Made into pills, each of which will contain <i>three grains of rhubarb</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8220;The <span class="smrom">DOSE OF THE PERSUADERS</span> must be adapted to the constitutional
peculiarity of the patient. When you wish to accelerate or augment the
alvine exoneration, take two, three, or more, according to the effect
you desire to produce. <i>Two pills</i> will do as much for one person, as
<i>five or six</i> will for another: they will generally very regularly
perform what you wish to-day, without interfering with what you hope
will happen to-morrow; and are therefore as convenient an argument
against constipation as any we are acquainted with.</p>

<p>&#8220;The most convenient opportunity to introduce them to the stomach, is
early in the morning, when it is unoccupied, and has no particular
business of digestion, &amp;c. to attend to&mdash;i. e. at least half an hour
before breakfast. Physic must never interrupt the stomach, when it is
busy in digesting food.</p>

<p>&#8220;From two to four persuaders will generally produce one additional
motion, within twelve hours. They may be taken at any time by the most
delicate females, whose constitutions are so often distressed by
constipation, and destroyed by the drastic purgatives they take to
relieve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cloth<a name="FNanchor_39-1_25" id="FNanchor_39-1_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_39-1_25" class="fnanchor">39-*</a> should be laid in the parlour, and all the paraphernalia
of the dinner-table completely arranged, at least half an hour before
dinner-time.</p>

<p>The cook&#8217;s labour will be lost, if the parlour-table be not ready for
action, and the eaters ready for the eatables, which the least delay
will irreparably injure: therefore, the <span class="smrom">GOURMAND</span> will be punctual for
the sake of gratifying his ruling passion; the <span class="smrom">INVALID</span>, to avoid the
danger of encountering an <i>indigestion</i> from eating ill-dressed food;
and the <span class="smrom">RATIONAL EPICURE</span>, who happily attends the banquet with &#8220;<i>mens
sana in corpore sano</i>,&#8221; will keep the time not only for these strong
reasons, but that he may not lose the advantage of being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> introduced to
the other guests. He considers not only what is on the table, but who
are around it: his principal inducement to leave his own fireside, is
the charm of agreeable and instructive society, and the opportunity of
making connexions, which may augment the interest and enjoyment of
existence.</p>

<p>It is the most pleasing part of the duty of the master of the feast
(especially when the guests are not very numerous), to take advantage of
these moments to introduce them to one another, naming them individually
in an audible voice, and adroitly laying hold of those ties of
acquaintanceship or profession which may exist between them.</p>

<p>This will much augment the pleasures of the festive board, to which it
is indeed as indispensable a prelude, as an overture is to an opera: and
the host will thus acquire an additional claim to the gratitude of his
guests. We urge this point more strongly, because, from want of
attention to it, we have seen more than once persons whom many kindred
ties would have drawn closely together, pass an entire day without
opening their lips to each other, because they were mutually ignorant of
each other&#8217;s names, professions, and pursuits.</p>

<p>To put an end at once to all ceremony as to the order in which the
guests are to sit, it will save much time and trouble, if the mistress
of the mansion adopts the simple and elegant method of placing the name
of each guest in the plate which is intended for him. This proceeding
will be of course the result of consideration, and the host will place
those together whom he thinks will harmonize best.</p>

<p><i>Le Journal des Dames</i> informs us, that in several fashionable houses in
Paris, a new arrangement has been introduced in placing the company at a
dinner-table.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ladies first take their places, leaving intervals for the
gentlemen; after being seated, each is desired to call on a gentleman to
sit beside her; and thus the lady of the house is relieved from all
embarrassment of <i>&eacute;tiquette</i> as to rank and pretensions,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>But, without doubt, says the Journalist, this method has its
inconveniences.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may happen that a bashful beauty dare not name the object of her
secret wishes; and an acute observer may determine, from a single
glance, that the <i>elected</i> is not always the <i>chosen</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the party is large, the founders of the feast may sit in the middle
of the table, instead of at each end, thus they will enjoy the pleasure
of attending equally to all their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> friends; and being in some degree
relieved from the occupation of carving, will have an opportunity of
administering all those little attentions which contribute so much to
the comfort of their guests.</p>

<p>If the <span class="smrom">GUESTS</span> have any respect for their <span class="smrom">HOST</span>, or prefer a well-dressed
dinner to one that is spoiled, instead of coming half an hour after,
they will take care to make their appearance a quarter of an hour before
the time appointed.</p>

<p>The operations of the cook are governed by the clock; the moment the
roasts, &amp;c. are ready, they must go to the table, if they are to be
eaten in perfection.</p>

<p>An invitation to come at <span class="smrom">FIVE</span> o&#8217;clock seems to be generally understood
to mean <i>six</i>; <span class="smrom">FIVE PRECISELY</span>, <i>half past five</i>; and <span class="smrom">NOT LATER THAN FIVE</span>
(so that dinner may be on the table within five minutes after, allowing
this for the variation of watches), <span class="smrom">FIVE O&#8217;CLOCK EXACTLY</span>.</p>

<p>Be it known to all loyal subjects of the empire of good-living, that the
<span class="smrom">COMMITTEE OF TASTE</span> have unanimously resolved, that &#8220;an invitation to
<span class="smrom">ETA. BETA. PI.</span> must be in writing, and sent at least ten days before the
banquet; and must be answered in writing (as soon as possible after it
is received), within twenty-four hours at least,&#8221; especially if it be
not accepted: then, in addition to the usual complimentary expressions
of thanks, &amp;c. the best possible reasons must be assigned for the
non-acceptance, as a particular pre-engagement, or severe indisposition,
&amp;c. Before the bearer of it delivers it, he should ascertain if the
person it is directed to is at home; if he is not, when he will be; and
if he is not in town, to bring the summons back.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more disobliging than a refusal which is not grounded on
some very strong and unavoidable cause,&mdash;except not coming at the
appointed hour;&mdash;&#8220;according to the laws of conviviality, a certificate
from a sheriff&#8217;s officer, a doctor, or an undertaker, are the only pleas
which are admissible. The duties which invitation imposes do not fall
only on the persons invited, but, like all other social duties, are
reciprocal.</p>

<p>&#8220;As he who has accepted an invitation cannot disengage himself from it;
the master of the feast cannot put off the entertainment on any pretence
whatever. Urgent business, sickness, not even death itself, can dispense
with the obligation which he is under of giving the entertainment for
which he has sent out invitations, which have been accepted; for in the
extreme cases of compulsory absence, or death, his place may be filled
by his friend or executor.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Vide le<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> Manuel des Amphitryons</i>, 8vo.
<i>Paris</i>, 1808; and <i>Cours Gastronomique</i>, 1809; to which the reader is
referred for farther instructions.</p>

<p>It is the least punishment that a blundering, ill-bred booby can
receive, who comes half an hour after the time he was bidden, to find
the soup removed, and the fish cold: moreover, for such an offence, let
him also be <i>mulcted</i> in a pecuniary penalty, to be applied to the <span class="smrom">FUND
FOR THE BENEFIT OF DECAYED COOKS</span>. This is the least punishment that can
be inflicted on one whose silence, or violation of an engagement, tends
to paralyze an entertainment, and to draw his friend into useless
expense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boileau</span>, the French satirist, has a shrewd observation on this subject.
&#8220;I have always been punctual at the hour of dinner,&#8221; says the bard; &#8220;for
I knew, that all those whom I kept waiting at that provoking interval,
would employ those unpleasant moments to sum up all my faults.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Boileau</span>
is indeed a man of genius, a very honest man; but that dilatory and
procrastinating way he has got into, would mar the virtues of an angel.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are some who seldom keep an appointment: we can assure them they
as seldom &#8220;&#8217;scape without whipping,&#8221; and exciting those murmurs which
inevitably proceed from the best-regulated stomachs, when they are
empty, and impatient to be filled.</p>

<p>The most amiable animals when hungry become ill-tempered: our best
friends employ the time they are kept waiting, in recollecting and
repeating any real faults we have, and attributing to us a thousand
imaginary ones.</p>

<p>Ill-bred beings, who indulge their own caprice, regardless how they
wound the feelings of others, if they possess brilliant and useful
talents, may occasionally be endured as convenient tools; but deceive
themselves sadly, even though they possess all the wisdom, and all the
wit in the world, if they fancy they can ever be esteemed as friends.</p>

<p>Wait for no one: as soon as the clock strikes, say grace, and begin the
business of the day,</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;And good digestion wait on appetite,<br />
And health on both.&#8221;</p>


<h3 class="subsection">MANNERS MAKE THE MAN.</h3>

<p>Good manners have often made the fortune of many, who have had nothing

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Ill manners have as often marred the hope of those who have had every

With rev&#8217;rend dulness and grave impotence,&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">and are incapable of comprehending the importance (especially when many

<p>Ceremony does not, in any thing, more commonly and completely triumph
over comfort, than in the administration of &#8220;the honours of the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those who serve out the loaves and fishes seldom seem to understand that
he is the best carver who fills the plates of the greatest number of
guests, in the least portion of time.</p>

<p>To effect this, fill the plates and send them round, instead of asking
each individual if they choose soup, fish, &amp;c. or what particular part
they prefer; for, as they cannot all be choosers, you will thus escape
making any invidious distinctions.</p>

<p>A dexterous <span class="smrom">CARVER</span><a name="FNanchor_43-1_26" id="FNanchor_43-1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_43-1_26" class="fnanchor">43-*</a> (especially if he be possessed with that
determined enemy to ceremony and sauce, a keen appetite,) will help half
a dozen people in half the time one of your would-be-thought polite
folks wastes in making civil faces, &amp;c. to a single guest.</p>

<p>It would save a great deal of time, &amp;c. if <span class="smrom">POULTRY</span>, especially large
turkeys and geese, were sent to table ready cut up. <a name="corr14" id="corr14"></a>(<a href="#no_530-1">No. 530.*</a>)</p>

<p>The guest who wishes to ensure a hearty welcome, and frequent invitation
to the board of hospitality, may calculate that the &#8220;easier he is
pleased, the oftener he will be invited.&#8221; Instead of unblushingly
demanding of the fair hostess that the prime &#8220;<i>tit-bit</i>&#8221; of every dish
be put on your plate, receive (if not with pleasure, or even content)
with the liveliest expressions of thankfulness whatever is presented to
you, and forget not to praise the cook, and the same shall be reckoned
unto you even as the praise of the mistress.</p>

<p>The invalid or the epicure, when he dines out, to save trouble to his
friends, may carry with him a portable <span class="smrom">MAGAZINE OF TASTE</span>. (See <a href="#no_462">No. 462</a>.)</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does not like his fare, he may console himself with the
reflection, that he need not expose his mouth to the like mortification
again: mercy to the feelings of the mistress of the mansion will forbid
his then appearing otherwise than absolutely delighted with it,
notwithstanding it may be his extreme antipathy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he likes it ever so little, he will find occasion to congratulate
himself on the advantage his digestive organs will derive from his
making a moderate dinner, and consolation from contemplating the double
relish he is creating for the following meal, and anticipating the (to
him) rare and delicious zest of (that best sauce) good appetite, and an
unrestrained indulgence of his gormandizing fancies at the chop-house he
frequents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never intrust a <i>cook-teaser</i> with the important office of <span class="smrom">CARVER</span>, or
place him within reach of <i>a sauce-boat</i>. These chop-house cormorants,

<p class="poem">&#8216;Critique your wine, and analyze your meat,<br />
Yet on plain pudding deign at home to eat,&#8217;</p>

<p class="noindent">are, generally, tremendously officious in serving out the loaves and
fishes of other people; for, under the notion of appearing exquisitely
amiable, and killingly agreeable to the guests, they are ever on the
watch to distribute themselves the dainties which it is the peculiar
part of the master and mistress to serve out, and is to them the most
pleasant part of the business of the banquet: the pleasure of helping
their friends is the gratification, which is their reward for the
trouble they have had in preparing the feast. Such gentry are the terror
of all good housewives: to obtain their favourite cut they will so
unmercifully mangle your joints, that a dainty dog would hardly get a
meal from them after; which, managed by the considerative hands of an
old housekeeper, would furnish a decent dinner for a large
family.&#8221;&mdash;Vide &#8220;<i>Almanach des Gourmands</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I once heard a gentle hint on this subject, given to a <i>blue-mould
fancier</i>, who by looking too long at a Stilton cheese, was at last
completely overcome, by his eye exciting his appetite, till it became
quite ungovernable; and unconscious of every thing but the <i>mity</i> object
of his contemplation, he began to pick out, in no small portions, the
primest parts his eye could select from the centre of the cheese.</p>

<p>The good-natured founder of the feast, highly amused at the ecstasies
each morsel created in its passage over the palate of the enraptured
<i>gourmand</i>, thus encouraged the perseverance of his guest&mdash;&#8220;Cut away, my
dear sir, cut away, use no ceremony, I pray: I hope you will pick out
all the best of my cheese. <i>Don&#8217;t you think</i> that <span class="smrom">THE RIND</span> <i>and the</i>
<span class="smrom">ROTTEN</span> <i>will do very well for my wife and family!!</i>&#8221; There is another
set of terribly <i>free and easy</i> folks, who are &#8220;fond of taking
possession of the throne of domestic comfort,&#8221; and then, with all the
impudence imaginable, simper out to the ousted master of the family,
&#8220;Dear me, I am afraid I have taken your place!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Half the trouble of</i> <span class="smrom">WAITING AT TABLE</span> <i>may be saved</i> by giving each
guest two plates, two knives and forks, two pieces of bread, a spoon, a
wine-glass, and a tumbler, and placing the wines and sauces, and the
<span class="smrom">MAGAZINE OF TASTE</span>, (<a href="#no_462">No. 462</a>,) &amp;c. as a <i>dormant</i>, in the centre of the
table; one neighbour may then help another.</p>

<p>Dinner-tables are seldom sufficiently lighted, or attended. An active
waiter will have enough to do to attend upon half a dozen active eaters.
There should be about half as many candles as there are guests, and
their flame be about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> eighteen inches above the table. Our foolish
modern pompous candelabras seem intended to illuminate the ceiling,
rather than to give light on the plates, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Wax lights at dinner are much more elegant, and not so troublesome and
so uncertain as lamps, nor so expensive; for to purchase a handsome lamp
will cost you more than will furnish you with wax candles for several
years.</p>

SERVANTS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> your first coming into a family, lose no time in immediately getting
into the good graces of your fellow-servants, that you may learn from
them the customs of the kitchen, and the various rules and orders of the
house.</p>

<p>Take care to be on good terms with the servant who waits at table; make
use of him as your sentinel, to inform you how your work has pleased in
the parlour: by his report you may be enabled in some measure to rectify
any mistake; but request the favour of an early interview with your
master or mistress: depend as little as possible on second-hand
opinions. Judge of your employers from <span class="smrom">YOUR OWN</span> observations, and <span class="smrom">THEIR</span>
behaviour to you, not from any idle reports from the other servants,
who, if your master or mistress inadvertently drop a word in your
praise, will immediately take alarm, and fearing your being more in
favour than themselves, will seldom stick at trifles to prevent it, by
pretending to take a prodigious liking to you, and poisoning your mind
in such a manner as to destroy all your confidence, &amp;c. in your
employers; and if they do not immediately succeed in worrying you away,
will take care you have no comfort while you stay: be most cautious of
those who profess most: not only beware of believing such honey-tongued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
folks, but beware as much of betraying your suspicions of them, for that
will set fire to the train at once, and of a doubtful friend make a
determined enemy.</p>

<p>If you are a good cook, and strictly do your duty, you will soon become
a favourite domestic; but never boast of the approbation of your
employers; for, in proportion as they think you rise in their
estimation, you will excite all the tricks, that envy, hatred, malice,
and all uncharitableness can suggest to your fellow-servants; every one
of whom, if less sober, honest, or industrious, or less favoured than
yourself, will be your enemy.</p>

<p>While we warn you against making others your enemies, take care that you
do not yourself become your own and greatest enemy. &#8220;Favourites are
never in greater danger of falling, than when in the greatest favour,&#8221;
which often begets a careless inattention to the commands of their
employers, and insolent overbearance to their equals, a gradual neglect
of duty, and a corresponding forfeiture of that regard which can only be
preserved by the means which created it.</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Those arts by which at first you gain it,<br />
You still must practise to maintain it.&#8221;</p>

<p>If your employers are so pleased with your conduct as to treat you as a
friend rather than a servant, do not let their kindness excite your
self-conceit, so as to make you for a moment forget you are one.
Condescension, even to a proverb, produces contempt in inconsiderate
minds; and to such, the very means which benevolence takes to cherish
attention to duty, becomes the cause of the evil it is intended to
prevent.</p>

<p>To be an agreeable companion in the kitchen, without compromising your
duty to your patrons in the parlour, requires no small portion of good
sense and good nature: in a word, you must &#8220;do as you would be done by.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act for, and speak of, every body as if they were present.</span></p>

<p>We hope the culinary student who peruses these pages will be above
adopting the common, mean, and ever unsuccessful way of &#8220;holding with
the hare, and running with the hounds,&#8221; of currying favour with
fellow-servants by flattering them, and ridiculing the mistress when in
the kitchen, and then, prancing into the parlour and purring about her,
and making opportunities to display all the little faults you can find
(<i>or invent</i>) that will tell well against those in the kitchen; assuring
them, on your return, that they were <i>vraised</i>, for whatever you heard
them <i>blamed</i>, and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> excite them to run more extremely into any little
error which you think will be most displeasing to their employers;
watching an opportunity to pour your poisonous lies into their
unsuspecting ears, when there is no third person to bear witness of your
iniquity; making your victims believe, it is all out of your <i>sincere
regard</i> for them; assuring them (as Betty says in the man of the world,)
&#8220;That indeed you are no busybody that loves fending nor proving, but
hate all tittling and tattling, and gossiping and backbiting,&#8221; &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Depend upon it, if you hear your fellow-servants speak disrespectfully
of a master or a mistress with whom they have lived some time, it is a
sure sign that they have some sinister scheme against yourself; if they
have not been well treated, why have they stayed?</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing more detestable than defamation. I have no scruple to
rank a slanderer with a murderer or an assassin. Those who assault the
reputation of their benefactors, and &#8216;rob you of that which nought
enriches them,&#8217; would destroy your life, if they could do it with equal
impunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you hope to gain the respect and esteem of others, and the
approbation of your own heart, be respectful and faithful to your
superiors, obliging and good-natured to your fellow-servants, and
charitable to all.&#8221; You cannot be too careful to cultivate a meek and
gentle disposition; you will find the benefit of it every day of your
life: to promote peace and harmony around you, will not only render you
a general favourite with your fellow-servants, but will make you happy
in yourself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let your <i>character</i> be remarkable for industry and moderation; your
<i>manners</i> and deportment, for modesty and humility; your <i>dress</i>
distinguished for simplicity, frugality, and neatness. A dressy servant
is a disgrace to a house, and renders her employers as ridiculous as she
does herself. If you outshine your companions in finery, you will
inevitably excite their envy, and make them your <a name="corr15" id="corr15"></a>enemies.&#8221;</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>&#8220;Do every thing at the proper time.&#8221;</li>
  <li>&#8220;Keep every thing in its proper place.&#8221;</li>
  <li>&#8220;Use every thing for its proper purpose.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>The importance of these three rules must be evident, to all who will
consider how much easier it is to return any thing when done with to its
proper place, than it is to find it when mislaid; and it is as easy to
put things in one place as in another.</p>

<p>Keep your kitchen and furniture as clean and neat as possible, which
will then be an ornament to it, a comfort to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> your fellow-servants, and
a credit to yourself. Moreover, good housewifery is the best
recommendation to a good husband, and engages men to honourable
attachment to you; she who is a tidy servant gives promise of being a
careful wife.</p>


<h3 class="subsection"><i>Giving away Victuals.</i></h3>

<p>Giving away any thing without consent or privity of your master or
mistress, is a liberty you must not take; charity and compassion for the
wants of our fellow-creatures are very amiable virtues, but they are not
to be indulged at the expense of your own honesty, and other people&#8217;s
property.</p>

<p>When you find that there is any thing to spare, and that it is in danger
of being spoiled by being kept too long, it is very commendable in you
to ask leave to dispose of it while it is fit for Christians to eat: if
such permission is refused, the sin does not lie at your door. But you
must on no account bestow the least morsel in contradiction to the will
of those to whom it belongs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never think any part of your business too trifling to be well done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eagerly embrace every opportunity of learning any thing which may be
useful to yourself, or of doing any thing which may benefit others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do not throw yourself out of a good place for a slight affront. &#8220;Come
when you are called, and do what you are bid.&#8221; Place yourself in your
mistress&#8217;s situation, and consider what you would expect from her, if
she were in yours; and serve, reverence, and obey her accordingly.</p>

<p>Although there may be &#8220;more places than parish-churches,&#8221; it is not very
easy to find many more good ones.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>&#8220;A rolling stone never gathers moss.&#8221;</li>
  <li>&#8220;Honesty is the best policy.&#8221;</li>
  <li>&#8220;A still tongue makes a wise head.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Saucy answers</i> are highly aggravating, and answer no good purpose.</p>

<p>Let your master or mistress scold ever so much, or be ever so
unreasonable; as &#8220;a soft answer turneth away wrath,&#8221; &#8220;so will <span class="smrom">SILENCE</span> be
<i>the best a servant can make</i>&#8221;.</p>

<p><i>One rude answer</i>, extorted perhaps by harsh words, or unmerited
censure, has cost many a servant the loss of a good place, or the total
forfeiture of a regard which had been growing for years.</p>

<p>&#8220;If your employers are hasty, and have scolded without reason, bear it
patiently; they will soon see their error, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> not be happy till they
make you amends. Muttering on leaving the room, or slamming the door
after you, is as bad as an impertinent reply; it is, in fact, showing
that you would be impertinent if you dared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A faithful servant will not only never speak disrespectfully <i>to</i> her
employers, but will not hear disrespectful words said <i>of</i> them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apply direct to your employers, and beg of them to explain to you, as
fully as possible, how they like their victuals dressed, whether much or
little done.<a name="FNanchor_50-1_29" id="FNanchor_50-1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_50-1_29" class="fnanchor">50-*</a></p>

<p>Of what complexion they wish the <span class="smrom">ROASTS</span>, of a gold colour, or well

<p class="poem">&#8220;Namque coquus domini debet habere gulam.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Martial.</span></p>

<p>It is impossible that the most accomplished cook can please their
palates, till she has learned their particular taste: this, it will
hardly be expected, she can hit exactly the first time; however, the
hints we have here given, and in the <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">7th</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">8th</a> chapters of the
Rudiments of Cookery, will very much facilitate the ascertainment of
this main chance of getting into their favour.</p>

<p>Be extremely cautious of seasoning high: leave it to the eaters to add
the piquante condiments, according to their own palate and fancy: for
this purpose, &#8220;<span class="smcap">The Magazine of Taste</span>,&#8221; or &#8220;<i>Sauce-box</i>,&#8221; (<a href="#no_462">No. 462</a>,) will
be found an invaluable acquisition; its contents will instantaneously
produce any flavour that may be desired.</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;De gustibus non est disputandum.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tastes are as different as faces; and without a most attentive
observation of the directions given by her employers, the most
experienced cook will never be esteemed a profound palatician.</p>

<p>It will not go far to pacify the rage of a ravenous <i>gourmand</i>, who
likes his chops broiled brown, (and done enough, so that they can appear
at table decently, and not blush when they are cut,) to be told that
some of the customers at Dolly&#8217;s chop-house choose to have them only
half-done, and that this is the best way of eating them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>We all think that is the best way which we relish best, and which agrees
best with our stomach: in this, reason and fashion, all-powerful as they
are on most occasions, yield to the imperative caprice of the palate.</p>

<i>on Drugs</i>.</p>

<p>Garlic and clove, or allspice, combined in certain proportions, produce
a flavour very similar to asaf&oelig;tida.</p>

<p>The organ of taste is more rarely found in perfection, and is sooner
spoiled by the operations of time, excessive use, &amp;c. than either of our
other senses.</p>

<p>There are as various degrees of sensibility of palate as there are of
gradations of perfection in the eyes and ears of painters and musicians.
After all the pains which the editor has taken to explain the harmony of
subtle relishes, unless nature has given the organ of taste in a due
degree, this book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> will, alas! no more make an <span class="smcap">Osborne</span>,<a name="FNanchor_52-1_31" id="FNanchor_52-1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_52-1_31" class="fnanchor">52-*</a> than it
can a <span class="smcap">Reynolds</span>, or an <span class="smcap">Arne</span>, or a <span class="smcap">Shield</span>.</p>

<p>Where nature has been most bountiful of this faculty, its sensibility is
so easily blunted by a variety of unavoidable circumstances, that the
tongue is very seldom in the highest condition for appreciating delicate
flavours, or accurately estimating the relative force of the various
materials the cook employs in the composition of an harmonious relish.
Cooks express this refinement of combination by saying, a well-finished
<i>rago&ucirc;t</i> &#8220;tastes of every thing, and tastes of nothing:&#8221; (this is
&#8220;<i>kitchen gibberish</i>&#8221; for a sauce in which the component parts are well
proportioned.)</p>

<p>However delicately sensitive nature may have formed the organs of taste,
it is only during those few happy moments that they are perfectly awake,
and in perfect good humour, (alas! how very seldom they are,) that the
most accomplished and experienced cook has a chance of working with any
degree of certainty without the auxiliary tests of the balance and the
measure: by the help of these, when you are once right, it is your own
fault if you are ever otherwise.</p>

<p>The sense of taste depends much on the health of the individual, and is
hardly ever for a single hour in the same state: such is the extremely
intimate sympathy between the stomach and the tongue, that in proportion
as the former is empty, the latter is acute and sensitive. This is the
cause that &#8220;good appetite is the best sauce,&#8221; and that the dish we find
savoury at <i>luncheon</i>, is insipid at <i>dinner</i>, and at <i>supper</i> quite
tasteless.</p>

<p>To taste any thing in perfection, the tongue must be moistened, or the
substance applied to it contain moisture; the nervous papill&aelig; which
constitute this sense are roused to still more lively sensibility by
salt, sugar, aromatics, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If the palate becomes dull by repeated tasting, one of the best ways of
refreshing it, is to masticate an apple, or to wash your mouth well with
milk.</p>

<p>The incessant exercise of tasting, which a cook is obliged to submit to
during the education of her tongue, frequently impairs the very faculty
she is trying to improve. &#8220;&#8217;Tis true &#8217;tis pity and pity &#8217;tis,&#8221; (says a
<i>grand gourmand</i>) &#8220;&#8217;tis true, her too anxious perseverance to penetrate
the mysteries of palatics may diminish the <i>tact</i>, exhaust the power,
and destroy the <i>index</i>, without which all her labour is in vain.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Therefore, a sagacious cook, instead of idly and wantonly wasting the
excitability of her palate, on the sensibility of which her reputation
and fortune depends, when she has ascertained the relative strength of
the flavour of the various ingredients she employs, will call in the
balance and the measure to do the ordinary business, and endeavour to
preserve her organ of taste with the utmost care, that it may be a
faithful oracle to refer to on grand occasions, and new
compositions.<a name="FNanchor_53-1_32" id="FNanchor_53-1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_53-1_32" class="fnanchor">53-*</a> Of these an ingenious cook may form as endless a
variety, as a musician with his seven notes, or a painter with his
colours: read chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">7</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">8</a> of the Rudiments of Cookery.</p>

<p>Receive as the highest testimonies of your employers&#8217; regard whatever
observations they may make on your work: such admonitions are the most
<i>unequivocal proofs</i> of their desire to make you thoroughly understand
their taste, and their wish to retain you in their service, or they
would not take the trouble to teach you.</p>

<p>Enter into all their plans of economy,<a name="FNanchor_53-2_33" id="FNanchor_53-2_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_53-2_33" class="fnanchor">53-&#8224;</a> and endeavour to make the
most of every thing, as well for your own honour as your master&#8217;s
profit, and you will find that whatever care you take for his profit
will be for your own: take care that the meat which is to make its
appearance again in the parlour is handsomely cut with a sharp knife,
and put on a clean dish: take care of the <i>gravy</i> (see <a href="#no_326">No. 326</a>) which is
left, it will save many pounds of meat in making sauce for <i>hashes</i>,
<i>poultry</i>, and many little dishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many things may be redressed</span> in a different form from that in which they
were first served, and improve the appearance of the table without
increasing the expense of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cold fish</span>, soles, cod, whitings, smelts, &amp;c. may be cut into bits, and
put into escallop shells, with cold oyster, lobster, or shrimp sauce,
and bread crumbled, and put into a Dutch oven, and browned like
scalloped oysters. (<a href="#no_182">No. 182</a>.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>The best way <span class="smrom">TO WARM COLD MEAT</span> is to sprinkle the joint over with a
little salt, and put it in a <span class="smcap">Dutch oven</span>, at some distance before a
gentle fire, that it may warm gradually; watch it carefully, and keep
turning it till it is quite hot and brown: it will take from twenty
minutes to three quarters of an hour, according to its thickness; serve
it up with gravy: this is much better than hashing it, and by doing it
nicely a cook will get great credit. <span class="smcap">Poultry</span> (<a href="#no_530-1">No. 530*</a>), <span class="smrom">FRIED FISH</span> (see
<a href="#no_145">No. 145</a>), &amp;c. may be redressed in this way.</p>

<p>Take care of the <i>liquor</i> you have boiled poultry or meat in; in five
minutes you may make it into <span class="smrom">EXCELLENT SOUP</span>. See <a href="#obs-555"><i>obs.</i></a> to Nos. <a href="#no_555">555</a> and
<a href="#obs-229">229</a>, <a href="#no_5">No. 5</a>, and the <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">7th chapter</a> of the Rudiments of Cookery.</p>

<p>No good housewife has any pretensions to <i>rational economy</i> who boils
animal food without converting the broth into some sort of soup.</p>

<p>However highly the uninitiated in the mystery of soup-making may elevate
the external appendage of his olfactory organ at the mention of &#8220;<span class="smrom">POT
LIQUOR</span>,&#8221; if he tastes <a href="#no_5">No. 5</a>, or <a href="#no_218">218</a>, <a href="#no_555">555</a>, &amp;c. he will be as delighted
with it as a Frenchman is with &#8220;<i>potage &agrave; la Camarani</i>,&#8221; of which it is
said &#8220;a single spoonful will lap the palate in Elysium; and while one
drop of it remains on the tongue, each other sense is eclipsed by the
voluptuous thrilling of the lingual nerves!!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Broth of fragments.</span>&mdash;When you dress a large dinner, you may make good
broth, or portable soup (<a href="#no_252">No. 252</a>), at very small cost, by taking care of
all the trimmings and parings of the meat, game, and poultry, you are
going to use: wash them well, and put them into a stewpan, with as much
cold water as will cover them; set your stewpan on a hot fire; when it
boils, take off all the scum, and set it on again to simmer gently; put
in two carrots, two turnips, a large onion, three blades of pounded
mace, and a head of celery; some mushroom parings will be a great
addition. Let it continue to simmer gently four or five hours; strain it
through a sieve into a clean basin. This will save a great deal of
expense in buying gravy-meat.</p>

<p>Have the <span class="smrom">DUST</span>, &amp;c. removed regularly once in a fortnight, and have your
<span class="smrom">KITCHEN CHIMNEY</span> swept once a month; many good dinners have been spoiled,
and many houses burned down, by the soot falling: the best security
against this, is for the cook to have a long birch-broom, and every
morning brush down all the soot within reach of it. Give notice to your
employers when the contents of your <span class="smrom">COAL-CELLAR</span> are diminished to a
chaldron.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>It will be to little purpose to procure good provisions, unless you have
proper utensils<a name="FNanchor_55-1_34" id="FNanchor_55-1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_55-1_34" class="fnanchor">55-*</a> to prepare them in: the most expert artist cannot
perform his work in a perfect manner without proper instruments; you
cannot have neat work without nice tools, nor can you dress victuals
well without an apparatus appropriate to the work required. See 1st page
of <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">chapter 7</a> of the Rudiments of Cookery.</p>

<p>In those houses where the cook enjoys the confidence of her employer so
much as to be intrusted with the care of the store-room, which is not
very common, she will keep an exact account of every thing as it comes
in, and insist upon the weight and price being fixed to every article
she purchases, and occasionally will (and it may not be amiss to
jocosely drop a hint to those who supply them that she does) <i>reweigh</i>
them, for her own satisfaction, as well as that of her employer, and
will not trust the key of this room to any one; she will also keep an
account of every thing she takes from it, and manage with as much
consideration and frugality as if it was her own property she was using,
endeavouring to disprove the adage, that &#8220;<span class="smrom">PLENTY</span> makes <i>waste</i>,&#8221; and
remembering that &#8220;wilful waste makes woful want.&#8221;</p>

<p>The honesty of a cook must be above all suspicion: she must obtain, and
(in spite of the numberless temptations, &amp;c. that daily offer to bend
her from it) preserve a character of spotless integrity and useful
industry,<a name="FNanchor_55-2_35" id="FNanchor_55-2_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_55-2_35" class="fnanchor">55-&#8224;</a> remembering that it is the fair price of <span class="smrom">INDEPENDENCE</span>,
which all wish for, but none without it can hope for; only a fool or a
madman will be so silly or so crazy as to expect to reap where he has
been too idle to sow.</p>

<p>Very few modern-built town-houses have a proper place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> to preserve
provisions in. The best substitute is a <span class="smrom">HANGING SAFE</span>, which you may
contrive to suspend in an airy situation; and when you order meat,
poultry, or fish, tell the tradesman when you intend to dress it: he
will then have it in his power to serve you with provision that will do
him credit, which the finest meat, &amp;c. in the world will never do,
unless it has been kept a proper time to be ripe and tender.</p>

<p>If you have a well-ventilated larder in a shady, dry situation, you may
make still surer, by ordering in your meat and poultry such a time
before you want it as will render it tender, which the finest meat
cannot be, unless hung a proper time (see <a href="#CHAPTER_II">2d chapter</a> of the Rudiments of
Cookery), according to the season, and nature of the meat, &amp;c.; but
always, as &#8220;<i>les bons hommes de bouche de France</i>&#8221; say, till <i>it is</i>
&#8220;<i>assez mortifi&eacute;e</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Permitting this process to proceed to a certain degree renders meat much
more easy of solution in the stomach, and for those whose digestive
faculties are delicate, it is of the utmost importance that it be
attended to with the greatest nicety, for the most consummate skill in
the culinary preparation of it will not compensate for the want of
attention to this. (Read <a href="#obs-68"><i>obs.</i></a> to <a href="#no_68">No. 68</a>.) Meat that is <i>thoroughly
roasted</i>, or <i>boiled</i>, eats much shorter and tenderer, and is in
proportion more digestible, than that which is <i>under</i>-done.</p>

<p>You will be enabled to manage much better if your employers will make
out a <span class="smrom">BILL OF FARE FOR THE WEEK</span> on the Saturday before: for example, for
a family of half a dozen&mdash;</p>

<p>It is an excellent plan to have certain things on certain days. When
your butcher or poulterer knows what you will want, he has a better
chance of doing his best for you; and never think of ordering <span class="smrom">BEEF FOR
ROASTING</span> except for Sunday.</p>

<p>When the weather or season<a name="FNanchor_56-1_36" id="FNanchor_56-1_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_56-1_36" class="fnanchor">56-*</a> is very unfavourable for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> keeping meat,
&amp;c. give him the choice of sending that which is in the best order for
dressing; <i>i. e.</i> either ribs or sirloin of beef, or leg, loin, or neck
of mutton, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Meat in which you can detect the slightest trace of putrescency, has
reached its highest degree of tenderness, and should be dressed without
delay; but before this period, which in some kinds of meat is offensive,
the due degree of inteneration may be ascertained, by its yielding
readily to the pressure of the finger, and by its opposing little
resistance to an attempt to bind the joint.</p>

<p>Although we strongly recommend that animal food should be hung up in the
open air, till its fibres have lost some degree of their toughness; yet,
let us be clearly understood also to warn you, that if kept till it
loses its natural sweetness, it is as detrimental to health, as it is
disagreeable to the smell and taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In very cold weather</span>, bring your meat, poultry, &amp;c. into the kitchen,
early in the morning, if you roast, boil, or stew it ever so gently and
ever so long; if it be <i>frozen</i>, it will continue tough and unchewable.</p>

<p>Without very watchful attention to this, the most skilful cook in the
world will get no credit, be she ever so careful in the management of
her spit or her stewpan.</p>

<p>The time meat should hang to be tender, depends on the heat and humidity
of the air. If it is not kept long enough, it is hard and tough; if too
long, it loses its flavour. It should be hung where it will have a
thorough air, and be dried with a cloth, night and morning, to keep it
from damp and mustiness.</p>

<p>Before you dress it, wash it well; if it is roasting beef, <i>pare off the
outside</i>.</p>

<p>If you fear meat,<a name="FNanchor_57-1_37" id="FNanchor_57-1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_57-1_37" class="fnanchor">57-*</a> &amp;c. will not keep till the time it is wanted,
<i>par</i>-roast or <i>par</i>-boil it; it will then keep a couple of days longer,
when it may be dressed in the usual way, only it will be done in rather
less time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>&#8220;In Germany, the method of keeping flesh in summer is to steep it in
Rhenish wine with a little sea-salt; by which means it may be preserved
a whole season.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Boerhaave&#8217;s</span> Academical Lectures, translated by J.
Nathan, 8vo. 1763, p. 241.</p>

<p>The cook and the butcher as often lose their credit by meat being
dressed too fresh, as the fishmonger does by fish that has been kept too
long.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin in his philosophical experiments tells us, that if game or
poultry be killed by <span class="smrom">ELECTRICITY</span> it will become tender in the twinkling
of an eye, and if it be dressed immediately, will be delicately tender.</p>

<p>During the <i>sultry</i> <span class="smrom">SUMMER MONTHS</span>, it is almost impossible to procure
meat that is not either tough, or tainted. The former is as improper as
the latter for the unbraced stomachs of relaxed valetudinarians, for
whom, at this season, poultry, stews, &amp;c., and vegetable soups, are the
most suitable food, when the digestive organs are debilitated by the
extreme heat, and profuse perspiration requires an increase of liquid to
restore equilibrium in the constitution.</p>

<p>I have taken much more pains than any of my predecessors, to teach the
young cook how to perform, in the best manner, the common business of
her profession. Being well grounded in the <span class="smrom">RUDIMENTS</span> of <span class="smrom">COOKERY</span>, she
will be able to execute the orders that are given her, with ease to
herself, and satisfaction to her employers, and send up a delicious
dinner, with half the usual expense and trouble.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to lessen the labour of those who wish to be
thoroughly acquainted with their profession; and an attentive perusal of
the following pages will save them much of the irksome drudgery
attending an apprenticeship at the stove: an ordeal so severe, that few
pass it without irreparable injury to their health;<a name="FNanchor_58-1_38" id="FNanchor_58-1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-1_38" class="fnanchor">58-*</a> and many lose
their lives before they learn their business.</p>

<p>To encourage the best performance of the machinery of mastication, the
cook must take care that her dinner is not only well cooked, but that
each dish be sent to table with its proper accompaniments, in the
neatest and most elegant manner.</p>

<p>Remember, to excite the good opinion of the <i>eye</i> is the first step
towards awakening the <i>appetite</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>Decoration is much more rationally employed in rendering a wholesome,
nutritious dish inviting, than in the elaborate embellishments which are
crowded about trifles and custards.</p>

<p>Endeavour to avoid <i>over</i>-dressing roasts and boils, &amp;c. and
<i>over</i>-seasoning soups and sauces with salt, pepper, &amp;c.; it is a fault
which cannot be mended.</p>

<p>If your roasts, &amp;c. are a little <i>under</i>-done, with the assistance of
the stewpan, the gridiron, or the Dutch oven, you may soon rectify the
mistake made with the spit or the pot.</p>

<p>If <i>over</i>-done, the best juices of the meat are evaporated; it will
serve merely to distend the stomach, and if the sensation of hunger be
removed, it is at the price of an indigestion.</p>

<p>The chief business of cookery is to render food easy of digestion, and
to facilitate nutrition. This is most completely accomplished by plain
cookery in perfection; i. e. neither <i>over</i> nor <i>under</i>-done.</p>

<p>With all your care, you will not get much credit by cooking to
perfection, if more than <i>one dish goes to table at a time</i>.</p>

<p>To be eaten in perfection, the interval between meat being taken out of
the stewpan and its being put into the mouth, must be as short as
possible; but ceremony, that most formidable enemy to good cheer, too
often decrees it otherwise, and the guests seldom get a bit of an
&#8220;<i>entremets</i>&#8221; till it is half cold. (See <a href="#no_485">No. 485</a>.)</p>

<p>So much time is often lost in placing every thing in apple-pie order,
that long before dinner is announced, all becomes lukewarm; and to
complete the mortification of the <i>grand gourmand</i>, his meat is put on a
sheet of ice in the shape of a plate, which instantly converts the gravy
into jelly, and the fat into a something which puzzles his teeth and the
roof of his mouth as much as if he had birdlime to masticate. A complete
<i>meat-screen</i> will answer the purpose of a <i>hot closet</i>, <i>plate-warmer</i>,
&amp;c.&mdash;See <a href="#INDEX">Index</a>.</p>

<p>It will save you infinite trouble and anxiety, if you can prevail on
your employers to use the &#8220;<span class="smrom">SAUCE-BOX</span>,&#8221; <a href="#no_462">No. 462</a>, hereinafter described in
the <a href="#GRAVIES_AND_SAUCES">chapter</a> of Sauces. With the help of this &#8220;<span class="smrom">MAGAZINE OF TASTE</span>,&#8221; every
one in company may flavour their soup and sauce, and adjust the
vibrations of their palate, exactly to their own fancy; but if the cook
give a decidedly predominant and <i>piquante go&ucirc;t</i> to a dish, to tickle
the tongues of two or three visiters, whose taste she knows, she may
thereby make the dinner disgusting to all the other guests.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Never undertake more work than you are quite certain you can do well. If
you are ordered to prepare a larger dinner than you think you can send
up with ease and neatness, or to dress any dish that you are not
acquainted with, rather than run any risk in spoiling any thing (by one
fault you may perhaps lose all your credit), request your employers to
let you have some help. They may acquit you for pleading guilty of
inability; but if you make an attempt, and fail, will vote it a capital
offence.</p>

<p>If your mistress professes to understand cookery, your best way will be
to follow her directions. If you wish to please her, let her have the
praise of all that is right, and cheerfully bear the blame of any thing
that is wrong; only advise that all <span class="smrom">NEW DISHES</span> may be first tried when
the family dine alone. When there is company, never attempt to dress any
thing which you have not ascertained that you can do perfectly well.</p>

<p>Do not trust any part of your work to others without carefully
overlooking them: whatever faults they commit, you will be censured for.
If you have forgotten any article which is indispensable for the day&#8217;s
dinner, request your employers to send one of the other servants for it.
The cook must never quit her post till her work is entirely finished.</p>

<p>It requires the utmost skill and contrivance to have all things done as
they should be, and all done together, at that critical moment when the
dinner-bell sounds &#8220;to the banquet.&#8221;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;A feast must be without a fault;<br />
And if &#8217;t is not all right, &#8217;t is naught.&#8221;</p>

<p>But</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Good nature will some failings overlook,<br />
Forgive mischance, not errors of the cook;<br />
As, if no salt is thrown about the dish,<br />
Or nice crisp&#8217;d parsley scatter&#8217;d on the fish,<br />
Shall we in passion from our dinner fly,<br />
And hopes of pardon to the cook deny,<br />
For things which Mrs. <span class="smcap">Glasse</span> herself might oversee,<br />
And all mankind commit as well as she?&#8221;<br />

<span class="i10">Vide <span class="smcap">King&#8217;s</span> <i>Art of Cookery</i>.</span></p>

<p>Such is the endless variety of culinary preparations, that it would be
as vain and fruitless a search as that for the philosopher&#8217;s stone, to
expect to find a cook who is quite perfect in all the operations of the
spit, the stewpan, and the rolling-pin: you will as soon find a
watchmaker who can make, put together, and regulate every part of a
watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;The universe cannot produce a cook who knows how to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> do every branch of
cookery well, be his genius as great as possible.&#8221;&mdash;Vide the <i>Cook&#8217;s
Cookery</i>, 8vo. page 40.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The best rule for marketing</span> is to <i>pay</i> <span class="smrom">READY MONEY</span> for every thing, and
to deal with the most respectable tradesmen in your neighbourhood.</p>

<p>If you leave it to their integrity to supply you with a good article, at
the fair market price, you will be supplied with better provisions, and
at as reasonable a rate as those bargain-hunters, who trot &#8220;around,
around, around about&#8221; a market, till they are trapped to buy some
<i>unchewable</i> old poultry, <i>tough</i> tup-mutton, <i>stringy</i> cow beef, or
<i>stale</i> fish, at a very little less than the price of prime and proper
food. With <i>savings</i> like these they toddle home in triumph, cackling
all the way, like a goose that has got ankle-deep into good luck.</p>

<p>All the skill of the most accomplished cook will avail nothing, unless
she is furnished with <span class="smrom">PRIME PROVISIONS</span>. The best way to procure these is
to deal with shops of established character: you may appear to pay,
perhaps, ten <i>per cent.</i> more than you would, were you to deal with
those who pretend to sell cheap, but you would be much more than in that
proportion better served.</p>

<p>Every trade has its tricks and deceptions: those who follow them can
deceive you if they please; and they are too apt to do so, if you
provoke the exercise of their over-reaching talent.<a name="FNanchor_61-1_39" id="FNanchor_61-1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_61-1_39" class="fnanchor">61-*</a></p>

<p>Challenge them to a game at &#8220;<i>Catch who can</i>,&#8221; by entirely relying on
your own judgment; and you will soon find that nothing but very long
experience can make you equal to the combat of marketing to the utmost
advantage.</p>

<p>Before you go to market, look over your larder, and consider well what
things are wanting, especially on a Saturday. No well-regulated family
can suffer a disorderly caterer to be jumping in and out to the
chandler&#8217;s shop on a Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Give your directions to your assistants, and begin your business early
in the morning, or it will be impossible to have the dinner ready at the
time it is ordered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>To be half an hour after the time is such a frequent fault, that there
is the more merit in being ready at the appointed hour. This is a
difficult task, and in the best-regulated family you can only be sure of
your time by proper arrangements.</p>

<p>With all our love of punctuality, we must not forget that the first
consideration must still be, that the dinner &#8220;be well done when &#8217;t is
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>If any accident occurs to any part of the dinner, or if you are likely
to be prevented sending the soup, &amp;c. to the table at the moment it is
expected, send up a message to your employers, stating the circumstance,
and bespeak their patience for as many minutes as you think it will take
to be ready. This is better than either keeping the company waiting
without an apology, or dishing your dinner before it is done enough, or
sending any thing to table which is disgusting to the stomachs of the
guests at the first appearance of it.</p>

<p>Those who desire regularity in the service of their table, should have a
<a name="corr17" id="corr17"></a><span class="smrom">DIAL</span>, of about twelve inches diameter, placed over the kitchen
fireplace, carefully regulated to keep time exactly with the clock in
the hall or dining-parlour; with a frame on one side, containing <span class="smrom">A TASTE
TABLE</span> of the peculiarities of the master&#8217;s palate, and the particular
rules and orders of his kitchen; and, on the other side, of the <span class="smrom">REWARDS</span>
given to those who attend to them, and for long and faithful service.</p>

<p>In small families, where a dinner is seldom given, a great deal of
preparation is required, and the preceding day must be devoted to the
business of the kitchen.</p>

<p>On these occasions a <i>char-woman</i> is often employed to do the dirty
work. Ignorant persons often hinder you more than they help you. We
advise a cook to be hired to assist to dress the dinner: this would be
very little more expense, and the work got through with much more
comfort in the kitchen and credit to the parlour.</p>

<p>When you have a very large entertainment to prepare, get your soups and
sauces, forcemeats, &amp;c. ready the day before, and read the <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">7th chapter</a>
of our <i>Rudiments of Cookery</i>. Many made dishes may also be prepared the
day before they are to go to table; but do not dress them <i>quite enough</i>
the first day, that they may not be <i>over</i>-done by warming up again.</p>

<p>Prepare every thing you can the day before the dinner, and order every
thing else to be sent in early in the morning; if the tradesmen forget
it, it will allow you time to send for it.</p>

<p>The pastry, jellies, &amp;c. you may prepare while the broths are doing:
then truss your game and poultry, and shape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> your collops, cutlets, &amp;c.,
and trim them neatly; cut away all flaps and gristles, &amp;c. Nothing
should appear on table but what has indisputable pretensions to be
eaten!</p>

<p>Put your made dishes in plates, and arrange them upon the dresser in
regular order. Next, see that your roasts and boils are all nicely
trimmed, trussed, &amp;c. and quite ready for the spit or the pot.</p>

<p>Have your vegetables neatly cut, pared, picked, and clean washed in the
colander: provide a tin dish, with partitions, to hold your fine herbs:
onions and shallots, parsley, thyme, tarragon, chervil, and burnet,
minced <i>very fine</i>; and lemon-peel grated, or cut thin, and chopped very
small: pepper and salt ready mixed, and your spice-box and salt-cellar
always ready for action: that every thing you may want may be at hand
for your stove-work, and not be scampering about the kitchen in a
whirlpool of confusion, hunting after these trifles while the dinner is
waiting.</p>

<p>In one drawer under your <span class="smrom">SPICE-BOX</span> keep ready ground, in well-stopped
bottles, the several spices separate; and also that mixture of them
which is called &#8220;<i>rago&ucirc;t powder</i>&#8221; (<a href="#no_457">No. 457</a> or <a href="#no_460">No. 460</a>): in another, keep
your dried and powdered sweet, savoury, and soup herbs, &amp;c. and a set of
weights and scales: you may have a third drawer, containing flavouring
essences, &amp;c. an invaluable auxiliary in finishing soups and sauces.
(See the account of the &#8220;<span class="smrom">MAGAZINE OF TASTE</span>,&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="smrom">SAUCE-BOX</span>,&#8221; <a href="#no_462">No. 462</a>.)</p>

<p>Have also ready some <span class="smrom">THICKENING</span>, made of the best white flour sifted,
mixed with soft water with a wooden spoon till it is the consistence of
thick batter, a bottle of plain <span class="smrom">BROWNING</span> (<a href="#no_322">No. 322</a>), some strained
lemon-juice, and some good glaze, or <span class="smrom">PORTABLE</span> soup (<a href="#no_252">No. 252</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing can be done in perfection which must be done in a hurry:&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_63-1_40" id="FNanchor_63-1_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_63-1_40" class="fnanchor">63-*</a>
therefore, if you wish the dinner to be sent up to please your master
and mistress, and do credit to yourself, be punctual; take care that as
soon as the <i>clock strikes</i>, the <i>dinner-bell rings</i>: this shows the
establishment to be orderly, is extremely gratifying to the master and
his guests, and is most praiseworthy in the attendants.</p>

<p>But remember, you cannot obtain this desirable reputation without good
management in every respect. If you wish to ensure ease and independence
in the latter part of your life, you must not be unwilling to pay the
price for which only they can be obtained, and earn them by a diligent
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> faithful<a name="FNanchor_64-1_41" id="FNanchor_64-1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_64-1_41" class="fnanchor">64-*</a> performance of the duties of your station in your
young days, which, if you steadily persevere in, you may depend upon
ultimately receiving the reward your services deserve.</p>

<p>All duties are reciprocal: and if you hope to receive favour, endeavour
to deserve it by showing yourself fond of obliging, and grateful when
obliged; such behaviour will win regard, and maintain it: enforce what
is right, and excuse what is wrong.</p>

<p>Quiet, steady perseverance is the only spring which you can safely
depend upon for infallibly promoting your progress on the road to
independence.</p>

<p>If your employers do not immediately appear to be sensible of your
endeavours to contribute your utmost to their comfort and interest, be
not easily discouraged. <i>Persevere</i>, and do all in your power to <span class="smrom">MAKE
YOURSELF USEFUL</span>.</p>

<p>Endeavour to promote the comfort of every individual in the family; let
it be manifest that you are desirous to do rather more than is required
of you, than less than your duty: they merit little who perform merely
what would be exacted. If you are desired to help in any business which
may not strictly belong to your department, undertake it cheerfully,
patiently, and conscientiously.</p>

<p>The foregoing advice has been written with an honest desire to augment
the comfort of those in the kitchen, who will soon find that the
ever-cheering reflection of having done their duty to the utmost of
their ability, is in itself, with a Christian spirit, a never-failing
source of comfort in all circumstances and situations, and that</p>

with the utmost ease, without injury to her health; which is not the
case in a large family, where the poor cook is roasting and stewing all
day, and is often deprived of her rest at night. No artists have greater
need to &#8220;<i>make hay while the sun shines</i>,&#8221; and timely provide for the
infirmities of age. Who will hire a superannuated servant? If she has
saved nothing to support herself, she must crawl to the workhouse.</p>

<p>It is melancholy to find, that, according to the authority of a certain
great French author, &#8220;cooks, half stewed and half roasted, when unable
to work any longer, generally retire to some unknown corner, and die in
forlornness and want.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Blackwood&#8217;s</span> <i>Edin. Mag.</i> vol. vii. p. 668.</p>

the quality of butcher-meat; depending upon the more or less plentiful
supply of food, upon the periodical change which takes place in the body
of the animal, and upon temperature. The flesh of most full-grown
quadrupeds is in highest season during the first months of winter, after
having enjoyed the advantage of the abundance of fresh summer food. Its
flavour then begins to be injured by the turnips, &amp;c. given as winter
food; and in spring, it gets lean from deficiency of food. Although beef
and mutton are never absolutely out of season, or not fit for the table,
they are best in November, December, and January. Pork is absolutely
bad, except during the winter.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Supplement to the Edin. Ency. Brit.</i>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> reduce our culinary operations to as exact a certainty as the nature
of the processes would admit of, we have, wherever it was needful, given
the quantities of each article.</p>

<p>The weights are <i>avoirdupois</i>.</p>

<p>The measure, the graduated glass of the apothecaries. This appeared the
most accurate and convenient; <i>the pint</i> being divided into sixteen
ounces, <i>the ounce</i> into eight drachms. A middling-sized <i>tea-spoon</i>
will contain about a drachm; four such tea-spoons are equal to a
middling-sized <i>table-spoon</i>, or half an ounce; four table-spoons to a
common-sized <i>wine-glass</i>.</p>

<p>The specific gravities of the various substances being so extremely
different, we cannot offer any auxiliary standards<a name="FNanchor_65-1_42" id="FNanchor_65-1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_65-1_42" class="fnanchor">65-*</a> for the
weights, which we earnestly recommend the cook to employ, if she wishes
to gain credit for accuracy and uniformity in her business: these she
will find it necessary to have as small as the quarter of a drachm
avoirdupois, which is equal to nearly seven grains troy.</p>

<p>Glass measures (divided into tea and table-spoons), containing from half
an ounce to half a pint, may be procured; also, the double-headed pepper
and spice boxes, with caps over the gratings. The superiority of these,
by preserving the contents from the action of the air, must be
sufficiently obvious to every one: the fine aromatic flavour of pepper
is soon lost, from the bottles it is usually kept in not being well
stopped. Peppers are seldom ground or pounded sufficiently fine. (See
<a href="#nb-369">N.B.</a> to <a href="#no_369">369</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> most simple of culinary processes is not often performed in
perfection. It does not require quite so much nicety and attendance as
roasting; to skim your pot well, and keep it really boiling (the slower
the better) all the while, to know how long is required for doing the
joint, &amp;c., and to take it up at the critical moment when it is done
enough, comprehends almost the whole art and mystery. This, however,
demands a patient and perpetual vigilance, of which few persons are
capable.</p>

<p>The cook must take especial care that the water really boils all the
while she is cooking, or she will be deceived in the time; and make up a
sufficient fire (a frugal cook will manage with much less fire for
boiling than she uses for roasting) at first, to last all the time,
without much mending or stirring.</p>

<p>When the pot is coming to a boil there will always, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> the cleanest
meat and clearest water, rise a <i>scum</i> to the top of it, proceeding
partly from the water; this must be carefully taken off as soon as it
rises.</p>

<p>On this depends the good appearance of all boiled things.</p>

<p>When you have skimmed well, put in some cold water, which will throw up
the rest of the scum.</p>

<p>The oftener it is skimmed, and the cleaner the top of the water is kept,
the sweeter and the cleaner will be the meat.</p>

<p>If let alone, it soon boils down and sticks to the meat,<a name="FNanchor_67-1_44" id="FNanchor_67-1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_67-1_44" class="fnanchor">67-*</a> which,
instead of looking delicately white and nice, will have that coarse and
filthy appearance we have too often to complain of, and the butcher and
poulterer be blamed for the carelessness of the cook in not skimming her
pot.</p>

<p>Many put in <i>milk</i>, to make what they boil look white; but this does
more harm than good: others wrap it up in a cloth; but these are
needless precautions: if the scum be attentively removed, meat will have
a much more delicate colour and finer flavour than it has when muffled
up. This may give rather more trouble, but those who wish to excel in
their art must only consider how the processes of it can be most
perfectly performed: a cook, who has a proper pride and pleasure in her
business, will make this her maxim on all occasions.</p>

<p>It is desirable that meat for boiling be of an equal thickness, or
before thicker parts are done enough the thinner will be done too much.</p>

<p>Put your meat into <i>cold</i><a name="FNanchor_67-2_45" id="FNanchor_67-2_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_67-2_45" class="fnanchor">67-&#8224;</a> water, in the proportion of about a
quart of water to a pound of meat: it should be covered with water
during the whole of the process of boiling, but not drowned in it; the
less water, provided the meat be covered with it, the more savoury will
be the meat, and the better will be the broth.</p>

<p>The water should be heated gradually, according to the thickness, &amp;c. of
the article boiled. For instance, a leg of mutton of 10 pounds weight
(<a href="#no_1">No. 1</a>,) should be placed over a moderate fire, which will gradually
make the water hot, without causing it to boil for about forty minutes;
if the water boils much sooner, the meat will be hardened, and shrink up
as if it was scorched: by keeping the water a certain time heating
without boiling, the fibres of the meat are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> dilated, and it yields a
quantity of scum, which must be taken off as soon as it rises.</p>

<p>&#8220;104. If a vessel containing water be placed over a steady fire, the
water will grow continually hotter till it reaches the limit of boiling,
after which the regular accessions of heat are wholly spent in
converting it into steam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Water remains at the same pitch of temperature, however fiercely it
boils. The only difference is, that with a strong fire it sooner comes
to boil, and more quickly boils away, and is converted into
steam.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Buchanan</span> <i>on the Economy of Fuel</i>, 1810.</p>

<p>The editor placed a thermometer in water in that state which cooks call
gentle simmering; the heat was 212&deg;, i. e. the same degree as the
strongest boiling.</p>

<p>Two mutton chops were covered with cold water, and one boiled a gallop,
and the other simmered very gently for three quarters of an hour: the
chop which was slowly simmered was decidedly superior to that which was
boiled; it was much tenderer, more juicy, and much higher flavoured. The
liquor which boiled fast was in like proportion more savoury, and when
cold had much more fat on its surface. This explains why quick boiling
renders meat hard, &amp;c., because its juices are extracted in a greater
degree.</p>

<p>Reckon the time from its first coming to a boil.</p>

<p>The old rule of 15 minutes to a pound of meat, we think rather too
little: the slower it boils, the tenderer, the plumper, and whiter it
will be.</p>

<p>For those who choose their food thoroughly cooked (which all will who
have any regard for their stomachs), twenty minutes to a pound for
fresh, and rather more for salted meat, will not be found too much for
gentle simmering by the side of the fire, allowing more or less time,
according to the thickness of the joint, and the coldness of the
weather: to know the state of which, let a thermometer be placed in the
pantry; and when it falls below 40&deg;, tell your cook to give rather more
time in both roasting and boiling, always remembering, the slower it
boils the better.</p>

<p>Without some practice it is difficult to teach any art; and cooks seem
to suppose they must be right, if they put meat into a pot, and set it
over the fire for a certain time, making no allowance whether it simmers
without a bubble or boils a gallop.</p>

<p>Fresh-killed meat will take much longer time boiling than that which has
been kept till it is what the butchers call <i>ripe</i>, and longer in <i>cold</i>
than in <i>warm</i> weather: if it be <i>frozen</i>, it must be thawed before
boiling as before roasting; if it be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> fresh-killed, it will be tough and
hard, if you stew it ever so long, and ever so gently. In cold weather,
the night before the day you dress it, bring it into a place of which
the temperature is not less than 45 degrees of Fahrenheit&#8217;s thermometer.</p>

<p>The size of the boiling-pots should be adapted to what they are to
contain: the larger the saucepan the more room it takes upon the fire,
and a larger quantity of water requires a proportionate increase of fire
to boil it.</p>

<p class="poem">A little pot<br />
Is soon hot.</p>

<p>In small families we recommend block tin saucepans, &amp;c. as lightest and
safest. If proper care is taken of them, and they are well dried after
they are cleaned, they are by far the cheapest; the purchase of a new
tin saucepan being little more than the expense of tinning a copper one.</p>

<p>Let the covers of your boiling-pots fit close, not only to prevent
unnecessary evaporation of the water, but to prevent the escape of the
nutritive matter, which must then remain either in the meat or in the
broth; and the smoke is prevented from insinuating itself under the edge
of the lid, and so giving the meat a bad taste. See observations on
Saucepans, in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">chapter 7</a>.</p>

<p>If you let meat or poultry remain in the water after it is done enough,
it will become sodden, and lose its flavour.</p>

<p>Beef and mutton a little <i>under</i>-done (especially very large joints,
which will make the better hash or broil,) is not a great fault; by some
people it is preferred: but lamb, pork, and veal are uneatable if not
thoroughly boiled; but do not <i>over</i>-do them.</p>

<p>A trivet or fish-drainer put on the bottom of the boiling-pot, raising
the contents about an inch and a half from the bottom, will prevent that
side of the meat which comes next the bottom from being done too much,
and the lower part of the meat will be as delicately done as the other
part; and this will enable you to take out the contents of the pot,
without sticking a fork, &amp;c. into it. If you have not a trivet, use four
skewers, or a soup-plate laid the wrong side upwards.</p>

<p>Take care of the liquor you have boiled poultry or meat in; in five
minutes you may make it into excellent soup. (See <a href="#obs-555">obs.</a> to <a href="#no_555">No. 555</a> and
<a href="#no_229">No. 229</a>.)</p>

<p>The good housewife never boils a joint without converting the broth into
some sort of soup (read <a href="#no_5">No. 5</a>, and <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">chapter 7</a>). If the liquor be too
salt, only use half the quantity, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> rest water. Wash salted meat
well with cold water before you put it into the boiler.</p>


<p class="hanging" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>An estimation of the</i> <span class="smrom">LOSS OF WEIGHT</span> <i>which takes place in cooking
animal food.</i>&mdash;<i>From</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Tilloch&#8217;s</span> <i>Philosophical Magazine.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It is well known, that in whatever way the flesh of animals is prepared
for food, a considerable diminution takes place in its weight. We do not
recollect, however, to have any where seen a statement of the loss which
meat sustains in the various culinary processes, although it is pretty
obvious that a series of experiments on the subject would not be without
their use in domestic economy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall here give the result of a series of experiments which were
actually made on this subject in a public establishment; premising that,
as they were not undertaken from mere curiosity, but, on the contrary,
to serve a purpose of practical utility, absolute accuracy was not
attended to. Considering, however, the large quantities of provisions
which were actually examined, it is presumed that the results may be
safely depended upon for any practical purpose. It would, no doubt, have
been desirable to have known not only the whole diminution of weight,
but also the parts which were separated from the meat in the form of
aqueous vapour, jelly, fat, &amp;c.; but the determination of these did not
fall within the scope of the inquiry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">&#8220;We shall only draw two practical inferences from the foregoing
statement.&mdash;1st, In respect of economy, it is more profitable to boil
meat than to roast it. 2dly, Whether we roast or boil meat, it loses by
being cooked from one-fifth to one-third of its whole weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The loss of roasting arises from the melting out of the fat, and
evaporating the water; but the nutritious matters remain condensed in
the cooked solid.</p>

<p>In boiling, the loss arises partly from the fat melted out, but chiefly
from <i>gelatine</i> and <i>osmazome</i> being extracted and dissolved by the
water in which the meat is boiled; there is, therefore, a real loss of
nourishment, unless the broth be used; when this mode of cooking becomes
the most economical.<a name="FNanchor_71-1_46" id="FNanchor_71-1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_71-1_46" class="fnanchor">71-*</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="BAKING" id="BAKING"></a>BAKING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following observations were written expressly for this work by Mr.
Turner, English and French bread and biscuit baker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baking is one of the cheapest and most convenient ways of dressing a
dinner in small families; and, I may say, that the oven is often the
only kitchen a poor man has, if he wishes to enjoy a joint of meat at
home with his family.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to deny the superior excellence of roasting to baking; but
some joints, when baked, so nearly approach to the same when roasted,
that I have known them to be carried to the table, and eaten as such
with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Legs and loins of pork, legs of mutton, fillets of veal, and many other
joints, will bake to great advantage, if the meat be good; I mean
well-fed, rather inclined to be fat: if the meat be poor, no baker can
give satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;When baking a poor joint of meat, before it has been half baked I have
seen it start from the bone, and shrivel up scarcely to be believed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides those joints above mentioned, I shall enumerate a few baked
dishes which I can particularly recommend.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pig, when sent to the baker prepared for baking, should have its ears
and tail covered with buttered paper properly fastened on, and a bit of
butter tied up in a piece of linen to baste the back with, otherwise it
will be apt to blister: with a proper share of attention from the baker,
I consider this way equal to a roasted one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>&#8220;A goose prepared the same as for roasting, taking care to have it on a
stand, and when half done to turn the other side upwards. A duck the
same.</p>

<p>&#8220;A buttock of beef the following way is particularly fine. After it has
been in salt about a week, to be well washed, and put into a brown
earthen pan with a pint of water; cover the pan tight with two or three
thicknesses of cap or foolscap paper: never cover any thing that is to
be baked with brown paper, the pitch and tar that is in brown paper will
give the meat a smoky, bad taste: give it four or five hours in a
moderately heated oven.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ham (if not too old) put in soak for an hour, taken out and wiped, a
crust made sufficient to cover it all over, and baked in a moderately
heated oven, cuts fuller of gravy, and of a finer flavour, than a boiled
one. I have been in the habit of baking small cod-fish, haddock, and
mackerel, with a dust of flour, and some bits of butter put on them;
eels, when large and stuffed; herrings and sprats, in a brown pan, with
vinegar and a little spice, and tied over with paper. A hare, prepared
the same as for roasting, with a few pieces of butter, and a little drop
of milk put into the dish, and basted several times, will be found
nearly equal to roasting; or cut it up, season it properly, put it into
a jar or pan, and cover it over and bake it in a moderate oven for about
three hours. In the same manner, I have been in the habit of baking legs
and shins of beef, ox cheeks, &amp;c. prepared with a seasoning of onions,
turnips, &amp;c.: they will take about four hours: let them stand till cold,
to skim off the fat; then warm it up all together, or part, as you may
want it.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these I have been in the habit of baking for the first families.</p>

<p>&#8220;The time each of the above articles should take depends much upon the
state of the oven, and I do consider the baker a sufficient judge; if
they are sent to him in time, he must be very neglectful if they are not
ready at the time they are ordered.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_66-1_43" id="Footnote_66-1_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66-1_43"><span class="label">66-*</span></a> &#8220;The process by which food is most commonly prepared for
the table, <span class="smrom">BOILING</span>, is so familiar to every one, and its effects are so
uniform, and apparently so simple, that few, I believe, have taken the
trouble to inquire <i>how</i> or <i>in what manner</i> those effects are produced;
and whether any, and what improvements in that branch of cookery are
possible. So little has this matter been an object of inquiry, that few,
very few indeed, I believe, among the <i>millions of persons</i> who for so
many ages have been <i>daily</i> employed in this process, have ever given
themselves the trouble to bestow one serious thought on the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Boiling</i> cannot be carried on without a very great expense of fuel;
but any boiling-hot liquid (by using proper means for confining the
heat) may be kept <i>boiling-hot</i> for any length of time almost without
any expense of fuel at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The waste of fuel</i> in culinary processes, which arises from making
liquids boil <i>unnecessarily</i>, or when nothing more would be necessary
than to keep them <i>boiling-hot</i>, is enormous; I have not a doubt but
that much more than half the fuel used in all the kitchens, public and
private, in the whole world, is wasted precisely in this manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the evil does not stop here. This unscientific and slovenly manner
of cooking renders the process much more laborious and troublesome than
otherwise it would be; and, (what by many will be considered of more
importance than either the waste of fuel or the increase of labour to
the cook) the food is rendered less savoury, and very probably less
nourishing and less wholesome.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is natural to suppose that many of the finer and more volatile parts
of food (those which are best calculated to act on the organs of taste),
must be carried off with the steam when the boiling is
violent.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Count</i> <span class="smcap">Rumford&#8217;s</span> 10th Essay, pp. <a name="corr19" id="corr19"></a>3, 6.</p>

carefully take it off when she dishes up, either with a clean sponge or
a paste-brush.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_67-2_45" id="Footnote_67-2_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67-2_45"><span class="label">67-&#8224;</span></a> Cooks, however, as well as doctors, disagree; for some
say, that &#8220;all sorts of fresh meat should be put in when the water
boils.&#8221; I prefer the above method for the reason given; gentle stewing
renders meat, &amp;c. tender, and still leaves it sapid and nutritive.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">ROASTING.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> all studies, it is the best practice to begin with the plainest and
easiest parts; and so on, by degrees, to such as are more difficult: we,
therefore, treated of plain boiling, and we now proceed to roasting: we
shall then gradually unravel to our culinary students the art (and
<i>mystery</i>, until developed in this work) of making, with the least
trouble and expense, the most highly finished soups, sauces, and
made-dishes.</p>

<p>Let the young cook never forget that cleanliness is the chief cardinal
virtue of the kitchen; the first preparation for roasting is to take
care that the spit be properly cleaned with sand and water; nothing
else. When it has been well scoured with this, dry it with a clean
cloth. If spits are wiped clean as soon as the meat is drawn from them,
and while they are hot, a very little cleaning will be required. The
less the spit is passed through the meat the better;<a name="FNanchor_74-1_47" id="FNanchor_74-1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_74-1_47" class="fnanchor">74-*</a> and, before
you spit it, joint it properly, especially necks and loins, that the
carver may separate them easily and neatly, and take especial care it be
evenly balanced on the spit, that its motion may be regular, and the
fire operate equally on each part of it; therefore, be provided with
balancing-skewers and cookholds, and see it is properly jointed.</p>

<p>Roasting should be done by the radiant heat of a clear, glowing fire,
otherwise it is in fact <i>baked</i>: the machines the economical
grate-makers call <span class="smrom">ROASTERS</span>, are, in plain English, ovens.</p>

<p>Count Rumford was certainly an exact economist of fuel, when he
contrived these things; and those philosophers who try all questions
&#8220;according to Cocker&#8221; may vote for baked victuals; but the rational
epicure, who has been accustomed to enjoy beef well roasted, will soon
be convinced that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> poet who wrote our national ballad at the end of
this chapter, was not inspired by Sir Benjamin Thompson&#8217;s cookery.</p>

<p>All your attention in roasting will be thrown away, if you do not take
care that your meat, especially beef, has been kept long enough to be
tender. See &#8220;<span class="smrom"><a href="#FRIENDLY_ADVICE_TO_COOKS">ADVICE TO COOKS</a></span>,&#8221; and <a href="#obs-68">obs.</a> to <a href="#no_68">No. 68</a>.</p>

<p>Make up the fire in time; let it be proportioned to the dinner to be
dressed, and about three or four inches longer at each end than the
thing to be roasted, or the ends of the meat cannot be done nice and
brown.</p>

<p>A cook must be as particular to proportion her fire to the business she
has to do, as a chemist: the degree of heat most desirable for dressing
the different sorts of food ought to be attended to with the utmost
precision.</p>

<p>The fire that is but just sufficient to receive the noble sirloin (<a href="#no_19">No.
19</a>), will parch up a lighter joint.</p>

<p>From half an hour to an hour before you begin to roast, prepare the fire
by putting a few coals on, which will be sufficiently lighted by the
time you wish to make use of your fire; between the bars, and on the
top, put small or large coals, according to the bulk of the joint, and
the time the fire is required to be strong; after which, throw the
cinders (wetted) at the back.</p>

<p>Never put meat down to a burned-up fire, if you can possibly avoid it;
but should the fire become fierce, place the spit at a considerable
distance, and allow a little more time.</p>

<p>Preserve the fat,<a name="FNanchor_75-1_48" id="FNanchor_75-1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_75-1_48" class="fnanchor">75-*</a> by covering it with paper, for this purpose
called &#8220;kitchen-paper,&#8221; and tie it on with fine twine; pins and skewers
can by no means be allowed; they are so many taps to let out the gravy:
besides, the paper often starts from them and catches fire, to the great
injury of the meat.</p>

<p>If the thing to be roasted be thin and tender, the fire should be little
and brisk: when you have a large joint to roast, make up a sound, strong
fire, equally good in every part of the grate, or your meat cannot be
equally roasted, nor have that uniform colour which constitutes the
beauty of good roasting.</p>

<p>Give the fire a good stirring before you lay the joint down; examine it
from time to time while the spit is going round; keep it clear at the
bottom, and take care there are no smoky coals in the front, which will
spoil the look and taste of the meat, and hinder it from roasting
evenly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>When the joint to be roasted is thicker at one end than the other, place
the spit slanting, with the thickest part nearest the fire.</p>

<p>Do not put meat too near the fire at first; the larger the joint, the
farther it must be kept from the fire: if once it gets scorched, the
outside will become hard, and acquire a disagreeable, empyreumatic
taste; and the fire being prevented from penetrating into it, the meat
will appear done before it is little more than half-done, besides losing
the pale brown colour, which it is the beauty of roasted meat to have.</p>

<p>From 14 to 10 inches is the usual distance at which meat is put from the
grate, when first put down. It is extremely difficult to offer any thing
like an accurate general rule for this, it depends so much upon the size
of the fire, and of that of the thing to be roasted.</p>

<p>Till some culinary philosopher shall invent a thermometer to ascertain
the heat of the fire, and a graduated spit-rack to regulate the distance
from it, the process of roasting is attended by so many ever-varying
circumstances, that it must remain among those which can only be
performed well, by frequent practice and attentive observation.</p>

<p>If you wish your jack to go well, keep it as clean as possible, oil it,
and then wipe it: if the oil is not wiped off again it will gather dust;
to prevent this, as soon as you have done roasting, cover it up. Never
leave the winders on while the jack is going round, unless you do it, as
Swift says, &#8220;that it may fly off, and knock those troublesome servants
on the head who will be crowding round your kitchen fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Be very careful to place the dripping-pan at such a distance from the
fire as just to catch the drippings: if it is too near, the ashes will
fall into it, and spoil the drippings<a name="FNanchor_76-1_49" id="FNanchor_76-1_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_76-1_49" class="fnanchor">76-*</a> (which we shall hereafter
show will occasionally be found an excellent substitute for butter or
lard). To clarify drippings, see (<a href="#no_83">No. 83</a>,) and pease and dripping soup
(<a href="#no_229">No. 229</a>), savoury and salubrious, for only a penny per quart. If it is
too far from the fire to catch them, you will not only lose your
drippings, but the meat will be blackened and spoiled by the f&oelig;tid
smoke, which will arise when the fat falls on the live cinders.</p>

<p>A large dripping-pan is convenient for several purposes. It should not
be less than 28 inches long and 20 inches wide, and have a covered well
on the side from the fire, to collect the drippings; this will preserve
them in the most delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> state: in a pan of the above size you may set
fried fish, and various dishes, to keep hot.</p>

<p>This is one of Painter&#8217;s and Hawke&#8217;s contrivances, near Norfolk-street,
Strand.</p>

<p>The time meat will take roasting will vary according to the time it has
been kept, and the temperature of the weather; the same weight<a name="FNanchor_77-1_50" id="FNanchor_77-1_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_77-1_50" class="fnanchor">77-*</a>
will be twenty minutes or half an hour longer in cold weather,<a name="FNanchor_77-2_51" id="FNanchor_77-2_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_77-2_51" class="fnanchor">77-&#8224;</a>
than it will be in warm; and if fresh killed, than if it has been kept
till it is tender.</p>

<p>A good meat-screen is a great saver of fuel. It should be on wheels,
have a flat top, and not be less than about three feet and a half wide,
and with shelves in it, about one foot deep; it will then answer all the
purposes of a large Dutch oven, plate-warmer, hot hearth, &amp;c. Some are
<a name="corr20" id="corr20"></a>made with a door behind: this is convenient, but the great heat they are
exposed to soon shrinks the materials, and the currents of air through
the cracks cannot be prevented, so they are better without the door. We
have seen one, which had on the top of it a very convenient <i>hot
closet</i>, which is a great acquisition in kitchens, where the dinner
waits after it is dressed.</p>

<p>Every body knows the advantage of <i>slow boiling</i>. <i>Slow roasting</i> is
equally important.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give any specific rule for time; but if your fire is
made as before directed, your meat-screen sufficiently large to guard
what you are dressing from currents of air, and the meat is not frosted,
you cannot do better than follow the old general rule of allowing rather
more than a quarter of an hour to the pound; a little more or less,
according to the temperature of the weather, in proportion as the piece
is thick or thin, the strength of the fire, the nearness of the meat to
it, and the frequency with which you baste it; the more it is basted the
less time it will take, as it keeps the meat soft and mellow on the
outside, and the fire acts with more force upon it.</p>

<p>Reckon the time, not to the hour when dinner is ordered, but to the
moment the roasts will be wanted. Supposing there are a dozen people to
sip soup and eat fish first, you may allow them ten or fifteen minutes
for the former, and about as long for the latter, more or less,
according to the temptations the &#8220;<span class="smrom">BON GOUT</span>&#8221; of these preceding courses
has to attract their attention.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>When the joint is half done, remove the spit and dripping-pan back, and
stir up your fire thoroughly, that it may burn clear and bright for the
browning; when the steam from the meat draws towards the fire,<a name="FNanchor_78-1_52" id="FNanchor_78-1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_78-1_52" class="fnanchor">78-*</a> it
is a sign of its being done enough; but you will be the best judge of
that, from the time it has been down, the strength of the fire you have
used, and the distance your spit has been from it.</p>

<p>Half an hour before your meat is done, make some gravy (<i>see Receipt</i>,
<a href="#no_326">No. 326</a>); and just before you take it up, put it nearer the fire to
brown it. If you wish to froth it, baste it, and dredge it with flour
carefully: you cannot do this delicately nice without a very good light.
The common fault seems to be using too much flour. The meat should have
a fine light varnish of froth, not the appearance of being covered with
a paste. Those who are particular about the froth use butter instead of
drippings; (see receipt to roast a turkey, <a href="#no_57">No. 57</a>)&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;And send up what you roast with relish-giving froth,&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">says Dr. King, and present such an agreeable appearance to the eye, that
the palate may be prepossessed in its favour at first sight; therefore,
have the whole course dished, before roasts are taken from the fire.</p>

<p>A good cook is as anxiously attentive to the appearance and colour of
her roasts, as a court beauty is to her complexion at a birthday ball.
If your meat does not brown so much, or so evenly as you wish, take two
ounces of Glaze, <i>i. e.</i> portable soup, put four table-spoonfuls of
water, and let it warm and dissolve gradually by the side of the fire.
This will be done in about a quarter of an hour; put it on the meat
equally all over with a paste-brush the last thing before it goes to
table.</p>

<p>Though roasting is one of the most common, and is generally considered
one of the most easy and simple processes of cookery, it requires more
unremitting attention to perform it perfectly well than it does to make
most made-dishes.</p>

<p>That made-dishes are the most difficult preparations, deserves to be
reckoned among the culinary vulgar errors; in plain roasting and boiling
it is not easy to repair a mistake once made; and all the discretion and
attention of a steady, careful cook, must be unremittingly upon the
alert.<a name="FNanchor_78-2_53" id="FNanchor_78-2_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_78-2_53" class="fnanchor">78-&#8224;</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>A diligent attention to time, the distance of the meat from, and
judicious management of, the fire, and frequent bastings,<a name="FNanchor_79-1_54" id="FNanchor_79-1_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_79-1_54" class="fnanchor">79-*</a> are all
the general rules we can prescribe. We shall deliver particular rules

roasting with a spit; a remark upon <span class="smrom">ROASTING BY A STRING</span> is necessary.
Let the cook, <i>before</i> she puts her meat down to the fire, pass a strong
skewer through <i>each end</i> of the joint: by this means, when it is about

<p><a name="Footnote_78-2_53" id="Footnote_78-2_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78-2_53"><span class="label">78-&#8224;</span></a> A celebrated French writer has given us the following
observations on roasting:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The art of roasting victuals to the precise degree, is one of the most
difficult in this world; and <i>you may find half a thousand good cooks
sooner than one perfect roaster</i>. (See &#8216;<i>Almanach des Gourmands</i>,&#8217; vol.
i. p. 37.) In the mansions of the opulent, they have, besides the master
kitchener, a roaster, (perfectly independent of the former,) who is
exclusively devoted to the spit.</p>

<p>&#8220;All erudite <i>gourmands</i> know that these two important functions cannot
be performed by one artist; it is quite impossible at the same time to
superintend the operations of the spit and stewpan.&#8221;&mdash;Further on, the
same author observes: &#8220;No certain rules can be given for roasting, the
perfection of it depending on many circumstances which are continually
changing; the age and size (especially the thickness) of the pieces, the
quality of the coals, the temperature of the atmosphere, the currents of
air in the kitchen, the more or less attention of the roaster; and,
lastly, the time of serving. Supposing the dinner ordered to be on table
at a certain time, if the fish and soup are much liked, and detained
longer than the roaster has calculated; or, on the contrary, if they are
despatched sooner than is expected, the roasts will in one case be burnt
up, in the other not done enough&mdash;two misfortunes equally to be
deplored. The first, however, is without a remedy; <i>five minutes on the
spit, more or less, decides the goodness of this mode of cookery</i>. It is
almost impossible to seize the precise instant when it ought to be
eaten; which epicures in roasts express by saying, &#8216;It is <i>done to a
turn</i>.&#8217; So that there is no exaggeration in saying, the perfect roaster
is even more rare than the professed cook.</p>

<p>&#8220;In small families, where the cook is also the roaster, it is almost
impossible the roasts should be well done: the spit claims exclusive
attention, and is an imperious mistress who demands the entire devotion
of her slave. But how can this be, when the cook is obliged, at the same
time, to attend her fish and soup-kettles, and watch her stewpans and
all their accompaniments?&mdash;it is morally and physically impossible: if
she gives that delicate and constant attention to the roasts which is
indispensably requisite, the rest of the dinner must often be spoiled;
and most cooks would rather lose their character as a roaster, than
neglect the made-dishes and &#8216;<i>entremets</i>,&#8217; &amp;c., where they think they
can display their <i>culinary science</i>,&mdash;than sacrifice these to the
roasts, the perfection of which will only prove their steady vigilance
and patience.&#8221;</p>

<span class="chaptitle">FRYING.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Frying</span> is often a convenient mode of cookery; it may be performed by a
fire which will not do for roasting or boiling; and by the introduction
of the pan between the meat and the fire, things get more equally
dressed.</p>

<p>The Dutch oven or bonnet is another very convenient utensil for small
things, and a very useful substitute for the jack, the gridiron, or
frying-pan.</p>

<p>A frying-pan should be about four inches deep, with a perfectly flat and
thick bottom, 12 inches long and 9 broad, with perpendicular sides, and
must be half filled with fat: good frying is, in fact, boiling in fat.
To make sure that the pan is quite clean, rub a little fat over it, and
then make it warm, and wipe it out with a clean cloth.</p>

<p>Be very particular in frying, never to use any oil, butter, lard, or
drippings, but what is quite clean, fresh, and free from salt. Any thing
dirty spoils the look; any thing bad-tasted or stale, spoils the
flavour; and salt prevents its browning.</p>

<p>Fine olive oil is the most delicate for frying; but the best oil is
expensive, and bad oil spoils every thing that is dressed with it.</p>

<p>For general purposes, and especially for fish, clean fresh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> lard is not
near so expensive as oil or clarified butter, and does almost as well.
Butter often burns before you are aware of it; and what you fry will get
a dark and dirty appearance.</p>

<p>Cooks in large kitchens, where there is a great deal of frying, commonly
use mutton or beef suet clarified (see <a href="#no_84">No. 84</a>): if from the kidney, all
the better.</p>

<p>Dripping, if nicely clean and fresh, is almost as good as any thing; if
not clean, it may be easily clarified (see <a href="#no_83">No. 83</a>). Whatever fat you
use, after you have done frying, let it remain in the pan for a few
minutes, and then pour it through a sieve into a clean basin; it will do
three or four times as well as it did at first, <i>i. e.</i> if it has not
burned: but, <i>Mem.</i> the fat you have fried fish in must not be used for
any other purpose.</p>

<p>To know when the fat is of a proper heat, according to what you are to
fry, is the great secret in frying.</p>

<p>To fry fish, parsley, potatoes, or any thing that is watery, your fire
must be very clear, and the fat quite hot; which you may be pretty sure
of, when it has done hissing, and is still. We cannot insist too
strongly on this point: if the fat is not very hot, you cannot fry fish
either to a good colour, or firm and crisp.</p>

<p>To be quite certain, throw a little bit of bread into the pan; if it
fries crisp, the fat is ready; if it burns the bread, it is too hot.</p>

<p>The fire under the pan must be clear and sharp, otherwise the fat is so
long before it becomes ready, and demands such attendance to prevent the
accident of its catching fire,<a name="FNanchor_81-1_55" id="FNanchor_81-1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_81-1_55" class="fnanchor">81-*</a> that the patience of cooks is
exhausted, and they frequently, from ignorance or impatience, throw in
what they are going to fry before the fat is half hot enough. Whatever
is so fried will be pale and sodden, and offend the palate and stomach
not less than the eye.</p>

<p>Have a good light to fry by, that you may see when you have got the
right colour: a lamp fixed on a stem, with a loaded foot, which has an
arm that lengthens out, and slides up and down like a reading
candlestick, is a most useful appendage to kitchen fireplaces, which are
very seldom light enough for the nicer operations of cookery.</p>

<p>After all, if you do not thoroughly drain the fat from what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> you have
fried, especially from those things that are full dressed in bread
crumbs,<a name="FNanchor_82-1_56" id="FNanchor_82-1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_82-1_56" class="fnanchor">82-*</a> or biscuit powder, &amp;c., your cooking will do you no
credit.</p>

<p>The dryness of fish depends much upon its having been fried in fat of a
due degree of heat; it is then crisp and dry in a few minutes after it
is taken out of the pan: when it is not, lay it on a soft cloth before
the fire, turning it occasionally, till it is. This will sometimes take
15 minutes: therefore, always fry fish as long as this before you want
them, for fear you may find this necessary.</p>

<p>To fry fish, see receipt to fry soles, (<a href="#no_145">No. 145</a>) which is the only
circumstantial account of the process that has yet been printed. If the
cook will study it with a little attention, she must soon become an
accomplished frier.</p>

<p>Frying, though one of the most common of culinary operations, is one
that is least commonly performed perfectly well.</p>

immediately wet a basket of ashes and throw them down the chimney, and
wet a blanket and hold it close all round the fireplace; as soon as the
current of air is stopped, the fire will be extinguished; with a
<span class="smrom">CHARCOAL STOVE</span> there is no danger, as the diameter of the pan exceeds

<span class="chaptitle">BROILING.</span></h2>

<p class="poem"><a name="corr21" id="corr21"></a>&#8220;And as now there is nought on the fire that is spoiling,<br />
We&#8217;ll give you just two or three hints upon broiling;<br />
How oft you must turn a beefsteak, and how seldom<br />
A good mutton chop, for to have &#8217;em both well done;<br />
And for skill in such cookery your credit &#8217;t will fetch up,<br />
If your broils are well-seasoned with good mushroom catchup.&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cleanliness</span> is extremely essential in this mode of cookery.</p>

<p>Keep your gridiron quite clean between the bars, and bright on the top:
when it is hot, wipe it well with a linen cloth: just before you use it,
rub the bars with clean mutton-suet, to prevent the meat from being
marked by the gridiron.</p>

<p>Take care to prepare your fire in time, so that it may burn quite clear:
a brisk and clear fire is indispensable, or you cannot give your meat
that browning which constitutes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> perfection of this mode of cookery,
and gives a relish to food it cannot receive any other way.</p>

<p>The chops or slices should be from half to three-quarters of an inch in
thickness; if thicker, they will be done too much on the outside before
the inside is done enough.</p>

<p>Be diligently attentive to watch the moment that any thing is done:
never hasten any thing that is broiling, lest you make smoke and spoil
it.</p>

<p>Let the bars of the gridiron be all hot through, but yet not burning hot
upon the surface: this is the perfect and fine condition of the
gridiron.</p>

<p>As the bars keep away as much heat as their breadth covers, it is
absolutely necessary they should be thoroughly hot before the thing to
be cooked be laid on them.</p>

<p>The bars of gridirons should be made concave, and terminate in a trough
to catch the gravy and keep the fat from dropping into the fire and
making a smoke, which will spoil the broil.</p>

<p>Upright gridirons are the best, as they can be used at any fire without
fear of smoke; and the gravy is preserved in the trough under them.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-83" id="nb-p-83"></a>N.B. Broils must be brought to table as hot as possible; set a dish to
heat when you put your chops on the gridiron, from whence to the mouth
their progress must be as quick as possible.</p>

<p>When the fire is not clear, the business of the gridiron may be done by
the Dutch oven or bonnet.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">VEGETABLES.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is nothing in which the difference between an elegant and an
ordinary table is more seen than in the dressing of vegetables, more
especially greens. They may be equally as fine at first, at one place as
at another; but their look and taste are afterward very different,
entirely from the careless way in which they have been cooked.</p>

<p>They are in greatest perfection when in greatest plenty, <i>i. e.</i> when in
full season.</p>

<p>By season, I do not mean those early days, that luxury in the buyers,
and avarice in the sellers, force the various vege<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>tables; but that time
of the year in which by nature and common culture, and the mere
operation of the sun and climate, they are in most plenty and
perfection.</p>

<p>Potatoes and pease are seldom worth eating before midsummer; unripe
vegetables are as insipid and unwholesome as unripe fruits.</p>

<p>As to the quality of vegetables, the middle size are preferred to the
largest or the smallest; they are more tender, juicy, and full of
flavour, just before they are quite full-grown. Freshness is their chief
value and excellence, and I should as soon think of roasting an animal
alive, as of boiling a vegetable after it is dead.</p>

<p>The eye easily discovers if they have been kept too long; they soon lose
their beauty in all respects.</p>

<p>Roots, greens, salads, &amp;c. and the various productions of the garden,
when first gathered, are plump and firm, and have a fragrant freshness
no art can give them again, when they have lost it by long keeping;
though it will refresh them a little to put them into cold spring water
for some time before they are dressed.</p>

<p>To boil them in soft water will preserve the colour best of such as are
green; if you have only hard water, put to it a tea-spoonful of
<i>carbonate of potash</i>.<a name="FNanchor_84-1_57" id="FNanchor_84-1_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_84-1_57" class="fnanchor">84-*</a></p>

<p>Take care to wash and cleanse them thoroughly from dust, dirt, and
insects: this requires great attention. Pick off all the outside leaves,
trim them nicely, and, if not quite fresh gathered and have become
flaccid, it is absolutely necessary to restore their crispness before
cooking them, or they will be tough and unpleasant: lay them in a pan of
clean water, with a handful of salt in it, for an hour before you dress
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most vegetables being more or less succulent, their full proportion of
fluids is necessary for their retaining that state of crispness and
plumpness which they have when growing. On being cut or gathered, the
exhalation from their surface continues, while, from the open vessels of
the cut surface, there is often great exudation or evaporation; and thus
their natural moisture is diminished, the tender leaves become flaccid,
and the thicker masses or roots lose their plumpness. This is not only
less pleasant to the eye, but is a real injury to the nutritious powers
of the vegetable; for in this flaccid and shrivelled state its fibres
are less easily divided in chewing, and the water which exists in
vegetable substances, in the form of their respective natural juices, is
directly nutri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>tious. The first care in the preservation of succulent
vegetables, therefore, is to prevent them from losing their natural
moisture.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Suppl. to Edin. Encyclop.</i> vol. iv. p. 335.</p>

<p>They should always be boiled in a sauce-pan by themselves, and have
plenty of water; if meat is boiled with them in the same pot, they will
spoil the look and taste of each other.</p>

<p>If you wish to have vegetables delicately clean, put on your pot, make
it boil, put a little salt in it, and skim it perfectly clean before you
put in the greens, &amp;c.; which should not be put in till the water boils
briskly: the quicker they boil, the greener they will be. When the
vegetables sink, they are generally done enough, if the water has been
kept constantly boiling. Take them up immediately, or they will lose
their colour and goodness. Drain the water from them thoroughly before
you send them to table.</p>

<p>This branch of cookery requires the most vigilant <a name="corr22" id="corr22"></a>attention.</p>

<p>If vegetables are a minute or two too long over the fire, they lose all
their beauty and flavour.</p>

<p>If not thoroughly boiled tender, they are tremendously indigestible, and
much more troublesome during their residence in the stomach, than
under-done meats.<a name="FNanchor_85-1_58" id="FNanchor_85-1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_85-1_58" class="fnanchor">85-*</a></p>

<p>To preserve or give colour in cookery, many good dishes are spoiled; but
the rational epicure who makes nourishment the main end of eating, will
be content to sacrifice the shadow to enjoy the substance. Vide <a href="#obs-322"><i>Obs.</i></a>
to <a href="#no_322">No. 322</a>.</p>

<p>Once for all, take care your vegetables are fresh: for as the fishmonger
often suffers for the sins of the cook, so the cook often gets
undeservedly blamed instead of the green-grocer.</p>

<p>Vegetables, in this metropolis, are often kept so long, that no art can
make them either look or eat well.</p>

<p>Strong-scented vegetables should be kept apart; leeks, or celery, laid
among cauliflowers, &amp;c. will quickly spoil them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Succulent vegetables are best preserved in a cool, shady, and damp
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Potatoes, turnips, carrots, and similar roots, intended to be stored
up, should never be cleaned from the earth adhering to them, till they
are to be dressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be protected from the action of the air and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> frost, by laying
them in heaps, burying them in sand or earth, &amp;c., or covering them with
straw or mats.</p>

rots.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Suppl. to Edin. Encyclop.</i> vol. iv. p. 335.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">FISH.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> department of the business of the kitchen requires considerable
experience, and depends more upon practice than any other. A very few
moments, more or less, will thoroughly spoil fish;<a name="FNanchor_86-1_59" id="FNanchor_86-1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_86-1_59" class="fnanchor">86-*</a> which, to be
eaten in perfection, must never be put on the table till the soup is
taken off.</p>

<p>So many circumstances operate on this occasion, that it is almost
impossible to write general rules.</p>

<p>There are decidedly different opinions, whether fish should be put into
cold, tepid, or boiling water.</p>

<p>We believe, for some of the fame the Dutch cooks have acquired, they are
a little indebted to their situation affording them a plentiful supply
of fresh fish for little more than the trouble of catching it; and that
the superior excellence of the fish in Holland, is because none are
used, unless they are brought alive into the kitchen (mackerel excepted,
which die the moment they are taken out of the water). The Dutch are as
nice about this as Seneca says the Romans<a name="FNanchor_86-2_60" id="FNanchor_86-2_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_86-2_60" class="fnanchor">86-&#8224;</a> were; who, complaining
of the luxury of the times, says,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> &#8220;They are come to that daintiness,
that they will not eat a fish, unless upon the same day that it is
taken, that it may taste of the sea, as they express it.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the Dutch flat coast, the fish are taken with nets: on our rocky
coast, they are mostly caught by bait and hook, which instantly kills
them. Fish are brought alive by land to the Dutch markets, in water
casks with air-holes in the top. Salmon, and other fish, are thus
preserved in rivers, in a well-hole in the fishing-boat.</p>

<p>All kinds of fish are best some time before they begin to spawn; and are
unfit for food for some time after they have spawned.</p>

<p>Fish, like animals, are fittest for the table when they are just full
grown; and what has been said in <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V</a>. respecting vegetables,
applies equally well to fish.</p>

<p>The most convenient utensil to boil fish in, is a turbot-kettle. This
should be 24 inches long, 22 wide, and 9 deep. It is an excellent vessel
to boil a ham in, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The good folks of this metropolis are so often disappointed by having
fish which has been kept too long, that they are apt to run into the
other extreme, and suppose that fish will not dress well unless it is
absolutely alive. This is true of lobsters, &amp;c. (<a href="#no_176">No. 176</a>), and may be of
fresh-water fish, but certainly not of some sea-fish.</p>

<p>Several respectable fishmongers and experienced cooks have assured the
editor, that they are often in danger of losing their credit by fish too
fresh, and especially turbot and cod, which, like meat, require a
certain time before they are in the best condition to be dressed. They
recommend them to be put into cold water, salted in proportion of about
a quarter of a pound of salt to a gallon of water. Sea-water is best to
boil sea-fish in. It not only saves the expense of salt, but the flavour
is better. Let them boil slowly till done; the sign of which is, that
the skin of the fish rises up, and the eyes turn white.</p>

<p>It is the business of the fishmonger to clean them, &amp;c. but the careful

<p>The melted butter (<a href="#no_256">No. 256</a>) for fish, should be thick enough to adhere

<span class="chaptitle">BROTHS AND SOUPS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cook must pay continual attention to the condition of her
stew-pans<a name="FNanchor_89-1_62" id="FNanchor_89-1_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_89-1_62" class="fnanchor">89-*</a> and soup-kettles, &amp;c. which should be examined every
time they are used. The prudent housewife will carefully examine the
condition of them herself at least once a month. Their covers also must
be kept perfectly clean and well tinned, and the stew-pans not only on
the inside, but about a couple of inches on the outside: many mischiefs
arise from their getting out of repair; and if not kept nicely tinned,
all your good work will be in vain; the broths and soups will look green
and dirty, taste bitter and poisonous, and will be spoiled both for the
eye and palate, and your credit will be lost.</p>

<p>The health, and even life of the family, depends upon this, and the cook
may be sure her employers had rather pay the tinman&#8217;s bill than the
doctor&#8217;s; therefore, attention to this cannot fail to engage the regard
of the mistress, between whom and the cook it will be my utmost
endeavour to promote perfect harmony.</p>

<p>If a servant has the misfortune to scorch or blister the tinning of her
pan,<a name="FNanchor_89-2_63" id="FNanchor_89-2_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_89-2_63" class="fnanchor">89-&#8224;</a> which will happen sometimes to the most careful cook, I
advise her, by all means, immediately to acquaint her employers, who
will thank her for candidly mentioning an accident; and censure her
deservedly if she conceal it.</p>

<p>Take care to be properly provided with sieves and tammy cloths, spoons
and ladles. Make it a rule without an exception, never to use them till
they are well cleaned and thoroughly dried, nor any stewpans, &amp;c.
without first washing them out with boiling water, and rubbing them well
with a dry cloth and a little bran, to clean them from grease, sand,
&amp;c., or any bad smell they may have got since they were last used: never
neglect this.</p>

<p>Though we do not suppose our cook to be such a naughty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> slut as to
wilfully neglect her broth-pots, &amp;c., yet we may recommend her to wash
them immediately, and take care they are thoroughly dried at the fire,
before they are put by, and to keep them in a dry place, for damp will
rust and destroy them very soon: attend to this the first moment you can
spare after the dinner is sent up.</p>

<p>Never put by any soup, gravy, &amp;c. in metal utensils; in which never keep
any thing longer than is absolutely necessary for the purposes of
cookery; the acid, vegetables, fat, &amp;c. employed in making soups, &amp;c.
are capable of dissolving such utensils; therefore stone or earthen
vessels should be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Stew-pans, soup-pots, and preserving pans, with thick and round bottoms
(such as sauce-pans are made with), will wear twice as long, and are
cleaned with half the trouble, as those whose sides are soldered to the
bottom, of which sand and grease get into the joined part, and cookeys
say that it is next to an impossibility to dislodge it, even if their
nails are as long as Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s. The Editor claims the credit bf
having first suggested the importance of this construction of these
utensils.</p>

<p>Take care that the lids fit as close as possible, that the broth, soup,
and sauces, &amp;c. may not waste by evaporation. They are good for nothing,
unless they fit tight enough to keep the steam in and the smoke out.</p>

<p>Stew-pans and sauce-pans should be always bright on the upper rim, where
the fire does not burn them; but to scour them all over is not only
giving the cook needless trouble, but wearing out the vessels. See
observations on sauce-pans in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>.</p>

<p>Cultivate habits of regularity and cleanliness, &amp;c. in all your
business, which you will then get through easily and comfortably. I do
not mean the restless spirit of <i>Molidusta</i>, &#8220;the <i>Tidy One</i>,&#8221; who is
anon, anon, Sir, frisking about in a whirlpool of bustle and confusion,
and is always dirty, under pretence of being always cleaning.</p>

<p>Lean, juicy beef, mutton, or veal, form the basis of broth; procure
those pieces which afford the richest succulence, and as fresh killed as
possible.<a name="FNanchor_90-1_64" id="FNanchor_90-1_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_90-1_64" class="fnanchor">90-*</a></p>

<p>Stale meat will make broth grouty and bad tasted, and fat meat is
wasted. This only applies to those broths which are required to be
perfectly clear: we shall show hereafter (in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> <a href="#no_229">No. 229</a>), that fat and
clarified drippings may be so combined with vegetable mucilage, as to
afford, at the small cost of one penny per quart, a nourishing and
palatable soup, fully adequate to satisfy appetite and support strength:
this will open a new source to those benevolent housekeepers, who are
disposed to relieve the poor, will show the industrious classes how much
they have it in their power to assist themselves, and rescue them from
being objects of charity dependent on the precarious bounty of others,
by teaching them how they may obtain a cheap, abundant, salubrious, and
agreeable aliment for themselves and families.</p>

<p>This soup has the advantage of being very easily and very soon made,
with no more fuel than is necessary to warm a room. Those who have not
tasted it, cannot imagine what a salubrious, savoury, and satisfying
meal is produced by the judicious combination of cheap homely
ingredients.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>The above materials, wine, and mushroom catchup (<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), combined in
various proportions, will make an endless variety<a name="FNanchor_93-1_73" id="FNanchor_93-1_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_93-1_73" class="fnanchor">93-*</a> of excellent
broths and soups, quite as pleasant to the palate, and as useful and
agreeable to the stomach, as consuming pheasants and partridges, and the
long list of inflammatory, <i>piquante</i>, and rare and costly articles,
recommended by former cookery-book makers, whose elaborately compounded
soups are like their made dishes; in which, though variety is aimed at,
every thing has the same taste, and nothing its own.</p>

<p>The general fault of our soups seems to be the employment of an excess
of spice, and too small a portion of roots and herbs.<a name="FNanchor_93-2_74" id="FNanchor_93-2_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_93-2_74" class="fnanchor">93-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>Besides the ingredients I have enumerated, many culinary scribes
indiscriminately cram into almost every dish (in such inordinate
quantities, one would suppose they were working for the <i>asbestos</i>
palate of an Indian fire-eater) anchovies, garlic,<a name="FNanchor_93-3_75" id="FNanchor_93-3_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_93-3_75" class="fnanchor">93-&#8225;</a> bay-leaves,
and that hot, fiery spice, <i>Cayenne</i><a name="FNanchor_93-4_76" id="FNanchor_93-4_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_93-4_76" class="fnanchor">93-&sect;</a> pepper; this, which the
French call (not undeservedly) <i>piment enrag&eacute;</i> (<a href="#no_404">No. 404</a>), has, somehow
or other, unaccountably acquired a character for being very wholesome;
while the milder peppers and spices are cried down, as destroying the
sensibility of the palate and stomach, &amp;c., and being the source of a
thousand mischiefs. We should just as soon recommend alcohol as being
less intoxicating than wine.</p>

<p>The best thing that has been said in praise of peppers is, &#8220;that with
all kinds of vegetables, as also with soups (especially vegetable soups)
and fish, either black or Cayenne pepper may be taken freely: they are
the most useful stimulants to old stomachs, and often supersede the
cravings for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> strong drinks; or diminish the quantity otherwise
required.&#8221; See Sir A. <span class="smcap">Carlisle</span> <i>on Old Age</i>, London, 1817. A certain
portion of condiment is occasionally serviceable to excite and keep up
the languid action of feeble and advanced life: we must increase the
stimulus of our aliment as the inirritability of our system increases.
We leave those who love these things to use them as they like; their
flavours can be very extemporaneously produced by chilly-juice, or
essence of Cayenne (<a href="#no_405">No. 405</a>), <a name="corr23" id="corr23"></a>eschalot wine (<a href="#no_402">No. 402</a>), and essence of
anchovy (<a href="#no_433">No. 433</a>).</p>

<p>There is no French dinner without soup, which is regarded as an
indispensable <i>overture</i>; it is commonly followed by &#8220;<i>le coup
d&#8217;Apr&egrave;s</i>,&#8221; a glass of pure wine, which they consider so wholesome after
soup, that their proverb says, the physician thereby loses a fee.
Whether the glass of wine be so much more advantageous for the patient
than it is for his doctor, we know not, but believe it an excellent plan
to begin the banquet with a basin of good soup, which, by moderating the
appetite for solid animal food, is certainly a salutiferous custom.
Between the <i>roasts</i> and the <i>entremets</i> they introduce &#8220;<i>le coup du
Milieu</i>&#8221; or a small glass of <i>Jamaica rum</i>, or <i>essence of punch</i> (see
<a href="#no_471">No. 471</a>), or <span class="smcap">Curacao</span> (<a href="#no_474">No. 474</a>).</p>

<p>The introduction of liqueurs is by no means a modern custom: our
ancestors were very fond of a highly spiced stimulus of this sort,
commonly called <i>Ipocrasse</i>, which generally made a part of the last
course, or was taken immediately after dinner.</p>


<h3 class="subsection"><i>The crafte to make ypocras.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;Take a quarte of red wyne, an ounce of synamon, and halfe an ounce of
gynger; a quarter of an ounce of greynes (probably of paradise) and long
pepper, and halfe a pounde of sugar; and brose (<i>bruise</i>) all this (<i>not
too small</i>), and then put them in a bage (<i>bag</i>) of wullen clothe, made,
therefore, with the wynee; and lete it hange over a vessel, till the
wynee be run thorowe.&#8221;&mdash;<i>An extract from Arnold&#8217;s Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>It is a custom which almost universally prevails in the northern parts
of Europe, to present <i>a dram</i> or glass of <i>liqueur</i>, before sitting
down to dinner: this answers the double purpose of a whet to the
appetite, and an announcement that dinner is on the point of being
served up. Along with the dram, are presented on a waiter, little square
pieces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> of cheese, slices of cold tongue, dried tongue, and dried toast,
accompanied with fresh <i>caviar</i>.</p>

<p>We again caution the cook to avoid over-seasoning, especially with
predominant flavours, which, however agreeable they may be to some, are
extremely disagreeable to others. See <a href="#Page_50">page 50</a>.</p>

beer, wine, and sweet herbs, and savoury spice (<a href="#no_460">No. 460</a>), are very
convenient auxiliaries to finish soups, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The proportion of wine (formerly sack, then claret, now Madeira or port)
should not exceed a large wine-glassful to a quart of soup. This is as
much as can be admitted, without the vinous flavour becoming remarkably
predominant; though not only much larger quantities of wine (of which
claret is incomparably the best, because it contains less spirit and
more flavour, and English palates are less acquainted with it), but even
<i>v&eacute;ritable eau de vie</i> is ordered in many books, and used by many
(especially tavern cooks). So much are their soups overloaded with
relish, that if you will eat enough of them they will certainly make you
drunk, if they don&#8217;t make you sick: all this frequently arises from an
old cook measuring the excitability of the eater&#8217;s palates by his own,
which may be so blunted by incessant tasting, that to awaken it,
requires wine instead of water, and Cayenne and garlic for black pepper
and onion.</p>

<p>Old cooks are as fond of <i>spice</i>, as children are of <i>sugar</i>, and season
soup, which is intended to constitute a principal part of a meal, as
highly as sauce, of which only a spoonful may be relish enough for a
plate of insipid viands. (See <a href="#obs-p-255"><i>obs.</i></a> to <a href="#no_355">No. 355</a>.) However, we fancy
these large quantities of wine, &amp;c. are oftener ordered in cookery books
than used in the kitchen: practical cooks have the health of their
employers too much at heart, and love &#8220;<i>sauce &agrave; la langue</i>&#8221; too well to
overwine their soup, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Truffles and morels<a name="FNanchor_95-1_77" id="FNanchor_95-1_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_95-1_77" class="fnanchor">95-*</a> are also set down as a part of most receipts.
These, in their green state, have a very rich high flavour, and are
delicious additions to some dishes, or sent up as a stew by themselves
when they are fresh and fine; but in this state they are not served up
half a dozen times in a year at the first tables in the kingdom: when
dried they become mere &#8220;<i>chips in pottage</i>,&#8221; and serve only to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> soak up
good gravy, from which they take more taste than they give.</p>

<p>The art of composing a rich soup is so to proportion the several
ingredients one to another, that no particular taste be stronger than
the rest, but to produce such a fine harmonious relish that the whole is
<a name="corr24" id="corr24"></a>delightful. This requires that judicious combination of the materials
which constitutes the &#8220;<i>chef d&#8217;&oelig;uvre</i>&#8221; of culinary science.</p>

<p>In the first place, take care that the roots and herbs be perfectly well
cleaned; proportion the water to the quantity of meat and other
ingredients, generally a pound of meat to a quart of water for soups,
and double that quantity for gravies. If they stew gently, little more
water need be put in at first than is expected at the end; for when the
pot is covered quite close, and the fire gentle, very little is wasted.</p>

<p>Gentle stewing is incomparably the best; the meat is more tender, and
the soup better flavoured.</p>

<p>It is of the first importance that the cover of a soup-kettle should fit
very close, or the broth will evaporate before you are aware of it. The
most essential parts are soon evaporated by quick boiling, without any
benefit, except to fatten the fortunate cook who inhales them. An
evident proof that these exhalations<a name="FNanchor_96-1_78" id="FNanchor_96-1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_96-1_78" class="fnanchor">96-*</a> possess the most restorative
qualities is, that <span class="smrom">THE COOK</span>, who is in general the least eater, is, as
generally, the <i>fattest</i> person in the family, from continually being
surrounded by the quintessence of all the food she dresses; whereof she
sends to <span class="smrom">HER MASTER</span> only the fibres and calcinations, who is
consequently <i>thin</i>, <i>gouty</i>, and the victim of diseases arising from
insufficient nourishment.</p>

<p>It is not only the <i>fibres</i> of the meat which nourish us, but the
<i>juices</i> they contain, and these are not only extracted but exhaled, if
it be boiled fast in an open vessel. A succulent soup can never be made
but in a well-closed vessel, which preserves the nutritive parts by
preventing their dissipation. This is a fact of which every intelligent
person will soon perceive the importance.</p>

<p>Place your soup-pot over a moderate fire, which will make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> the water hot
without causing it to boil for at least half an hour; if the water boils
immediately, it will not penetrate the meat, and cleanse it from the
clotted blood, and other matters which ought to go off in scum; the meat
will be hardened all over by violent heat; will shrink up as if it was
scorched, and give hardly any gravy: on the contrary, by keeping the
water a certain time heating without boiling, the meat swells, becomes
tender, its fibres are dilated, and it yields a quantity of <i>scum</i>,
which must be taken off as soon as it appears.</p>

<p>It is not till after a good half hour&#8217;s hot infusion that we may mend
the fire, and make the pot boil: still continue to remove <i>the scum</i>;
and when no more appears, put in the vegetables, &amp;c. and a little salt.
These will cause more <i>scum</i> to rise, which must be taken off
immediately; then cover the pot very closely, and place it at a proper
distance from the fire, where it will boil very gently, and equally, and
by no means fast.</p>

<p>By quick and strong boiling the volatile and finest parts of the
ingredients are evaporated, and fly off with the steam, and the coarser
parts are rendered soluble; so you lose the good, and get the bad.</p>

<p>Soups will generally take from <i>three</i> to <i>six</i> hours.</p>

<p>Prepare your broths and soups the evening before you want them. This
will give you more time to attend to the rest of your dinner the next
day; and when the soup is cold, the <i>fat</i> may be much more easily and
completely removed from the surface of it. When you decant it, take care
not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the vessel, which are so
fine that they will escape through a sieve, or even through a <span class="smrom">TAMIS</span>,
which is the best strainer, the soups appear smoother and finer, and it
is much easier cleaned than any sieve. If you strain it while it is hot,
pass it through a clean tamis or napkin, previously soaked in cold
water; the coldness of this will coagulate the fat, and only suffer the
pure broth to pass through.</p>

<p>The full flavour of the ingredients can only be extracted by very long
and slow simmering; during which take care to prevent evaporation, by
covering the pot as close as possible: the best stew-pot is a digester.</p>

<p>Clear soups must be perfectly transparent; thickened soups, about the
consistence of rich cream; and remember that thickened soups require
nearly double the quantity of seasoning. The <i>piquance</i> of spice, &amp;c. is
as much blunted by the flour and butter, as the spirit of rum is by the
addition of sugar and acid: so they are less salubrious, without being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
more savoury, from the additional quantity of spice, &amp;c. that is
smuggled into the stomach.</p>

<p>To thicken and give body to soups and sauces, the following materials
are used: they must be gradually mixed with the soup till thoroughly
incorporated with it; and it should have at least half an hour&#8217;s gentle
simmering after: if it is at all lumpy, pass it through a tamis or a
fine sieve. Bread raspings, bread, isinglass, potato mucilage (<a href="#no_448">No. 448</a>),
flour, or fat skimmings and flour (see <a href="#no_248">No. 248</a>), or flour and butter,
barley (see <a href="#no_204">No. 204</a>), rice, or oatmeal and water rubbed well together,
(see <a href="#no_257">No. 257</a>, in which this subject is fully explained.)</p>

<p>To give that <i>glutinous</i> quality so much admired in <i>mock turtle</i>, see
<a href="#no_198">No. 198</a>, and <a href="#Footnote_219-1_172">note</a> under <a href="#no_247">No. 247</a>, <a href="#no_252">No. 252</a>, and <a href="#nb-481">N.B.</a> to <a href="#no_481">No. 481</a>.</p>

<p>To their very rich gravies, &amp;c. the French add the white meat of
partridges, pigeons, or fowls, pounded to a pulp, and rubbed through a
sieve. A piece of beef, which has been boiled to make broth, pounded in
the like manner with a bit of butter and flour, see <a href="#no_recipe"><i>obs.</i></a> to <a href="#no_recipe">No. 485*</a>
and <a href="#no_503">No. 503</a>, and gradually incorporated with the gravy or soup, will be
found a satisfactory substitute for these more expensive articles.</p>

<p>Meat from which broth has been made <a name="corr25" id="corr25"></a>(<a href="#no_185">No. 185</a>, and <a href="#no_252">No. 252</a>), and all its
juice has been extracted, is then excellently well prepared for <span class="smrom">POTTING</span>,
(see <a href="#no_503">No. 503</a>), and is quite as good, or better, than that which has been
baked till it is dry;<a name="FNanchor_98-1_79" id="FNanchor_98-1_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_98-1_79" class="fnanchor">98-*</a> indeed, if it be pounded, and seasoned in
the usual manner, it will be an elegant and savoury luncheon, or supper,
and costs nothing but the trouble of preparing it, which is very little,
and a relish is procured for sandwiches, &amp;c. (<a href="#no_504">No. 504</a>) of what
heretofore has been by the poorest housekeeper considered <i>the
perquisite of the</i> <span class="smrom">CAT</span>.</p>

<p>Keep some spare broth lest your soup-liquor waste in boiling, and get
too thick, and for gravy for your made dishes, various sauces, &amp;c.; for
many of which it is a much better basis than melted butter.</p>

<p>The soup of mock turtle, and the other thickened soups, (<a href="#no_247">No. 247</a>), will
supply you with a thick gravy sauce for <i>poultry</i>, <i>fish</i>, <i>rago&ucirc;ts</i>,
&amp;c.; and by a little management of this sort, you may generally contrive
to have plenty of good gravies and good sauces with very little trouble
or expense. See also <i>Portable Soup</i> (<a href="#no_252">No. 252</a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>If soup is too thin or too weak, take off the cover of your soup-pot,
and let it boil till some of the watery part of it has evaporated, or
else add some of the thickening materials we have before mentioned; and
have at hand some plain browning: see <a href="#no_322">No. 322</a>, and the <a href="#obs-322"><i>obs.</i></a> thereon.
This simple preparation is much better than any of the compounds bearing
that name; as it colours sauce or soup without much interfering with its
flavour, and is a much better way of colouring them than burning the
surface of the meat.</p>

<p>When soups and gravies are kept from day to day, <i>in hot weather</i>, they
should be warmed up every day, and put into fresh-scalded tureens or
pans, and placed in a cool cellar; in temperate weather every other day
may be enough.</p>

<p>We hope we have now put the common cook into possession of the whole
<i>arcana</i> of soup-making, without much trouble to herself, or expense to
her employers. It need not be said in future that an Englishman only
knows how to make soup in his stomach, by swilling down a large quantity
of ale or porter, to quench the thirst occasioned by the meat he eats.
<span class="smcap">John Bull</span> may now make his soup &#8220;<i>secund&ugrave;m artem</i>,&#8221; and save his
principal viscera a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p><sup class="astsup">*</sup><sub class="astsub">*</sub><sup class="astsup">*</sup> In the following receipts we have directed the spices<a name="FNanchor_99-1_80" id="FNanchor_99-1_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_99-1_80" class="fnanchor">99-*</a> and
flavouring to be added at the usual time; but it would greatly diminish
the expense, and improve the soups, if the agents employed to give them
a zest were not put in above fifteen minutes before the finish, and half
the quantity of spice, &amp;c. would do. A strong heat soon dissipates the
spirit of the wine, and evaporates the aroma and flavour of the spices
and herbs, which are volatile in the heat of boiling water.</p>

<p>In ordering the proportions of meat, butter, wine, &amp;c. the proper
quantity is set down, and less will not do: we have carried economy
quite as far as possible without &#8220;spoiling the broth for a halfpenny
worth of salt.&#8221;</p>

<p>I conclude these remarks with observing, that some persons imagine that
soup tends to relax the stomach. So far from being prejudicial, we
consider the moderate use of such liquid nourishment to be highly
salutary. Does not our food and drink, even though cold, become in a few
minutes a kind of warm soup in the stomach? and therefore soup, if not
eaten too hot, or in too great a quantity, and of proper quality, is
attended with great advantages, especially to those who drink but
little.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>Warm fluids, in the form of soup, unite with our juices much sooner and
better than those that are cold and raw: on this account, <span class="smrom">RESTORATIVE
SOUP</span> is the best food for those who are enfeebled by disease or
dissipation, and for old people, whose teeth and digestive organs are
impaired.</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Half subtilized to chyle, the liquid food<br />
Readiest obeys th&#8217; assimilating powers.&#8221;</p>

<p>After catching cold, in nervous headaches, cholics, indigestions, and
different kinds of cramp and spasms in the stomach, warm broth is of
excellent service.</p>

<p>After intemperate feasting, to give the stomach a holyday for a day or
two by a diet on mutton broth (<a href="#no_564">No. 564</a>, or <a href="#no_572">No. 572</a>), or vegetable soup
(<a href="#no_218">No. 218</a>), &amp;c. is the best way to restore its tone. &#8220;The stretching any
power to its utmost extent weakens it. If the stomach be every day
obliged to do as much as it can, it will every day be able to do less. A
wise traveller will never force his horse to perform as much as he can
in one day upon a long journey.&#8221;&mdash;Father <span class="smcap">Feyjoo&#8217;s</span> <i>Rules</i>, p. 85.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is of as much importance that the cook should know how to make a boat
of good gravy for her poultry, &amp;c. as that it should be sent up of
proper complexion, and nicely frothed.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we shall endeavour to introduce to her all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> the
materials<a name="FNanchor_101-1_81" id="FNanchor_101-1_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_101-1_81" class="fnanchor">101-*</a> which give flavour in <i>sauce</i>, which is the <i>essence of
soup</i>, and intended to contain more relish in a <i>tea-spoonful</i> than the
former does in a <i>table-spoonful</i>.</p>

<p>We hope to deserve as much praise from the <i>economist</i> as we do from the
<i>bon vivant</i>; as we have taken great pains to introduce to him the
methods of making substitutes for those ingredients, which are always
expensive, and often not to be had at all. Many of these cheap articles
are as savoury and as salutary as the dearer ones, and those who have
large families and limited incomes, will, no doubt, be glad to avail
themselves of them.</p>

<p>The reader may rest assured, that whether he consults this book to
diminish the expense or increase the pleasures of hospitality, he will
find all the information that was to be obtained up to 1826,
communicated in the most unreserved and intelligible manner.</p>

<p>A great deal of the elegance of cookery depends upon the accompaniments
to each dish being appropriate and well adapted to it.</p>

<p>We can assure our readers, no attention has been wanting on our part to
render this department of the work worthy of their perusal; each receipt
is the faithful narrative of actual and repeated experiments, and has
received the most deliberate consideration before it was here presented
to them. It is given in the most circumstantial manner, and not in the
technical and mysterious language former writers on these subjects seem
to have preferred; by which their directions are useless and
unintelligible to all who have not regularly served an apprenticeship at
the stove.</p>

<p>Thus, instead of accurately enumerating the quantities, and explaining
the process of each composition, they order a ladleful of <i>stock</i>, a
pint of <i>consomm&eacute;</i>, and a spoonful of <i>cullis</i>; as if a private-family
cook had always at hand a soup-kettle full of <i>stock</i>, a store of
<i>consomm&eacute;</i>, and the larder of <i>Albion house</i>, and the <i>spoons</i> and
<i>pennyworths</i> were the same in all ages.</p>

<p>It will be to very little purpose that I have taken so much pains to
teach how to manage roasts and boils, if a cook cannot or will not make
the several sauces that are usually sent up with them.</p>

<p>The most homely fare may be made relishing, and the most excellent and
independent improved by a well-made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> sauce;<a name="FNanchor_102-1_82" id="FNanchor_102-1_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_102-1_82" class="fnanchor">102-*</a> as the most perfect
picture may, by being well varnished.</p>

<p>We have, therefore, endeavoured to give the plainest directions how to
produce, with the least trouble and expense<a name="FNanchor_102-2_83" id="FNanchor_102-2_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_102-2_83" class="fnanchor">102-&#8224;</a> possible, all the
various compositions the English kitchen affords; and hope to present
such a wholesome and palatable variety as will suit all tastes and all
pockets, so that a cook may give satisfaction in all families. The more
combinations of this sort she is acquainted with, the better she will
comprehend the management of every one of them.</p>

<p>We have rejected some <i>outlandish farragoes</i>, from a conviction that
they were by no means adapted to an English palate. If they have been
received into some English books, for the sake of swelling the volume,
we believe they will never be received by an Englishman&#8217;s stomach,
unless for the reason they were admitted into the cookery book, <i>i. e.</i>
because he has nothing else to put into it.</p>

<p>However &#8220;<i>les pompeuses bagatelles de la Cuisine Masqu&eacute;e</i>&#8221; may tickle
the fancy of <i>demi-connoisseurs</i>, who, leaving the substance to pursue
the shadow, prefer wonderful and whimsical metamorphoses, and things
extravagantly expensive to those which are intrinsically excellent; in
whose mouth mutton can hardly hope for a welcome, unless accompanied by
venison sauce; or a rabbit, any chance for a race down the red lane,
without assuming the form of a frog or a spider; or pork, without being
either &#8220;<i>goosified</i>&#8221; or &#8220;<i>lambi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>fied</i>&#8221; (see <a href="#no_51">No. 51</a>); and game and
poultry in the shape of crawfish or hedgehogs; these travesties rather
show the patience than the science of the cook, and the bad taste of
those who prefer such baby-tricks to nourishing and substantial plain
cookery.</p>

<p>I could have made this the biggest book with half the trouble it has
taken me to make it the best: concentration and perspicuity have been my
aim.</p>

<p>As much pains have been taken in describing, in the most intelligible
manner, how to make, in the easiest, most agreeable, and economical way,
those common sauces that daily contribute to the comfort of the middle
ranks of society; as in directing the preparation of those extravagant
and elaborate double relishes, the most ingenious and accomplished
&#8220;<i>officers of the mouth</i>&#8221; have invented for the amusement of profound
palaticians, and thorough-bred <i>grands gourmands</i> of the first
magnitude: these we have so reduced the trouble and expense of making,
as to bring them within the reach of moderate fortunes; still preserving
all that is valuable of their taste and qualities; so ordering them,
that they may delight the palate, without disordering the stomach, by
leaving out those inflammatory ingredients which are only fit for an
&#8220;iron throat and adamantine bowels,&#8221; and those costly materials which no
rational being would destroy, for the wanton purpose of merely giving a
fine name to the compositions they enter into, to whose excellence they
contribute nothing else. For instance, consuming <i>two</i> partridges to
make sauce for <i>one</i>: half a pint of game gravy (<a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>,) will be
infinitely more acceptable to the unsophisticated appetite of
Englishmen, for whose proper and rational recreation we sat down to
compose these receipts; whose approbation we have done our utmost to
deserve, by devoting much time to the business of the kitchen; and by
repeating the various processes that we thought admitted of the smallest
improvement.</p>

<p>We shall be fully gratified, if our book is not bought up with quite so
much avidity by those high-bred epicures, who are unhappily so much more
nice than wise, that they cannot eat any thing dressed by an English
cook; and vote it barbarously unrefined and intolerably ungenteel, to
endure the sight of the best bill of fare that can be contrived, if
written in the vulgar tongue of old England.<a name="FNanchor_103-1_84" id="FNanchor_103-1_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_103-1_84" class="fnanchor">103-*</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Let your sauces each display a decided character; send up your plain
sauces (oyster, lobster, &amp;c.) as pure as possible: they should only
taste of the materials from which they take their name.</p>

<p>The imagination of most cooks is so incessantly on the hunt for a
relish, that they seem to think they cannot make sauce sufficiently
savoury without putting into it every thing that ever was eaten; and
supposing every addition must be an improvement, they frequently
overpower the natural flavour of their <span class="smrom">PLAIN SAUCES</span>, by overloading them
with salt and spices, &amp;c.: but, remember, these will be deteriorated by
any addition, save only just salt enough to awaken the palate. The lover
of &#8220;<i>piquance</i>&#8221; and compound flavours, may have recourse to &#8220;<i>the
Magazine of Taste</i>,&#8221; <a href="#no_462">No. 462</a>.</p>

<p>On the contrary, of <span class="smrom">COMPOUND SAUCES</span>; the ingredients should be so nicely
proportioned, that no one be predominant; so that from the equal union
of the combined flavours such a fine mellow mixture is produced, whose
very novelty cannot fail of being acceptable to the persevering
<i>gourmand</i>, if it has not pretensions to a permanent place at his table.</p>

<p>An ingenious <i>cook</i> will form as endless a variety of these compositions
as a <i>musician</i> with his seven<a name="FNanchor_104-1_85" id="FNanchor_104-1_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_104-1_85" class="fnanchor">104-*</a> notes, or a <i>painter</i> with his
colours; no part of her business offers so fair and frequent an
opportunity to display her abilities: <span class="smrom">SPICES</span>, <span class="smrom">HERBS</span>, &amp;c. are often very
absurdly and injudiciously jumbled together.</p>

<p>Why have clove and allspice, or mace and nutmeg, in the same sauce; or
marjoram, thyme, and savoury; or onions, leeks, <a name="corr30" id="corr30"></a>eschalots, and garlic?
one will very well supply the place of the other, and the frugal cook
may save something considerable by attending to this, to the advantage
of her employers, and her own time and trouble. You might as well, to
make soup, order one quart of water from the <i>Thames</i>, another from the
<i>New River</i>, a third from <i>Hampstead</i>, and a fourth from <i>Chelsea</i>, with
a certain portion of <i>spring</i> and <i>rain</i> water.</p>

<p>In many of our receipts we have fallen in with the fashion of ordering a
mixture of spices, &amp;c., which the above hint will enable the culinary
student to correct.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Pharmacy</span> is now much more simple; <span class="smrom">COOKERY</span> may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> made so too. A
prescription which is now compounded with five ingredients, had formerly
fifty in it: people begin to understand that the materia medica is
little more than a collection of evacuants and stimuli.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Boswell&#8217;s
Life of Johnson.</i></p>

<p>The <i>rago&ucirc;ts of the last century</i> had infinitely more ingredients than
we use now; the praise given to <i>Will. Rabisha</i> for his Cookery, 12mo.
1673, is</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;To fry and fricassee, his way&#8217;s most neat,<br />
For he compounds a thousand sorts of meat.&#8221;</p>

<p>To become a perfect mistress of the art of cleverly extracting and
combining flavours,<a name="FNanchor_105-1_86" id="FNanchor_105-1_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_105-1_86" class="fnanchor">105-*</a> besides the gift of a good taste, requires
all the experience and skill of the most accomplished professor, and,
especially, an intimate acquaintance with the palate she is working for.</p>

<p>Send your sauces to table as hot as possible.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more unsightly than the surface of a sauce in a frozen
state, or garnished with grease on the top. The best way to get rid of
this, is to pass it through a tamis or napkin previously soaked in cold
water; the coldness of the napkin will coagulate the fat, and only
suffer the pure gravy to pass through: if any particles of fat remain,
take them off by applying filtering paper, as blotting paper is applied
to writing.</p>

<p>Let your sauces boil up after you put in wine, anchovy, or thickening,
that their flavours may be well blended with the other
ingredients;<a name="FNanchor_105-2_87" id="FNanchor_105-2_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_105-2_87" class="fnanchor">105-&#8224;</a> and keep in mind that the &#8220;<i>chef-d&#8217;&oelig;uvre</i>&#8221; of
<span class="smrom">COOKERY</span> is, to entertain the mouth without offending the stomach.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-105" id="nb-p-105"></a>N.B. Although I have endeavoured to give the particular quantity of each
ingredient used in the following sauces, as they are generally made;
still the cook&#8217;s judgment must direct her to lessen or increase either
of the ingredients, according to the taste of those she works for, and
will always be on the alert to ascertain what are the favourite
<i>accompaniments</i> desired with each dish. See <i>Advice to Cooks</i>, <a href="#Page_50">page 50</a>.</p>

<p>When you open a bottle of <i>catchup</i> (<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), <i>essence of anchovy</i> (<a href="#no_433">No.
433</a>), &amp;c., throw away the old cork, and stop it closely with a new cork
that will fit it very tight. Use only the best superfine velvet
taper-corks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Economy in corks is extremely unwise: in order to save a mere trifle in
the price of the cork, you run the risk of losing the valuable article
it is intended to preserve.</p>

<p>It is a <i>vulgar error</i> that a bottle must be well stopped, when the cork
is forced down even with the mouth of it; it is rather a sign that the
cork is too small, and it should be redrawn and a larger one put in.</p>


<h3 class="subsection"><i>To make bottle-cement.</i></h3>

<p>Half a pound of black resin, same quantity of red sealing-wax, quarter
oz. bees&#8217; wax, melted in an earthen or iron pot; when it froths up,
before all is melted and likely to boil over, stir it with a tallow
candle, which will settle the froth till all is melted and fit for use.
Red wax, 10<i>d.</i> per lb. may be bought at Mr. Dew&#8217;s Blackmore-street,
Clare-market.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-106" id="nb-p-106"></a>N.B. This cement is of very great use in preserving things that you wish
to keep a long time, which without its help would soon spoil, from the
clumsy and ineffectual manner in which the bottles are corked.</p>

<p>&#8220;To speak, then, of the knowledge which belongs unto our British

<span class="chaptitle">MADE DISHES.</span></h2>


<p>Under this general head we range our receipts for <span class="smrom">HASHES</span>, <span class="smrom">STEWS</span>, and
<span class="smrom">RAGOUTS</span>,<a name="FNanchor_106-1_88" id="FNanchor_106-1_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_106-1_88" class="fnanchor">106-*</a> &amp;c. Of these there are a great multitude, affording the
ingenious cook an inexhaustible store of variety: in the French kitchen
they count upwards of 600, and are daily inventing new ones.</p>

<p>We have very few general observations to make, after what we have
already said in the two preceding chapters on <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII"><i>sauces</i></a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VII"><i>soups</i></a>, &amp;c.,
which apply to the present chapter, as they form the principal part of
the accompaniment of most of these dishes. In fact, <span class="smrom">MADE DISHES</span> are
nothing more than meat, poultry (<a href="#no_530">No. 530</a>), or fish (Nos. <a href="#no_146">146</a>, <a href="#no_158">158</a>, or
<a href="#no_164">164</a>), stewed very gently till they are tender, with a thickened sauce
poured over them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Be careful to trim off all the skin, gristle, &amp;c. that will not be
eaten; and shape handsomely, and of even thickness, the various articles
which compose your made dishes: this is sadly neglected by common cooks.
Only stew them till they are just tender, and do not stew them to rags;
therefore, what you prepare the day before it is to be eaten, do not
dress quite enough the first day.</p>

<p>We have given receipts for the most easy and simple way to make <span class="smrom">HASHES</span>,
&amp;c. Those who are well skilled in culinary arts can dress up things in
this way, so as to be as agreeable as they were the first time they were
cooked. But hashing is a very bad mode of cookery: if meat has been done
enough the first time it is dressed, a second dressing will divest it of
all its nutritive juices; and if it can be smuggled into the stomach by
bribing the palate with <i>piquante</i> sauce, it is at the hazard of an
indigestion, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I promise those who do me the honour to put my receipts into practice,
that they will find that the most nutritious and truly elegant dishes
are neither the most difficult to dress, the most expensive, nor the
most indigestible. In these compositions experience will go far to
diminish expense: meat that is too old or too tough for roasting, &amp;c.,
may by gentle stewing be rendered savoury and tender. If some of our
receipts do differ a little from those in former cookery books, let it
be remembered we have advanced nothing in this work that has not been
tried, and experience has proved correct.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Beef bouilli</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_5" id="no_5"></a>No. 5.)</h3>

<p>In plain English, is understood to mean boiled beef; but its culinary
acceptation, in the French kitchen, is fresh beef dressed without
boiling, and only very gently simmered by a slow fire.</p>

<p>Cooks have seldom any notion, that good soup can be made without
destroying a great deal of meat; however, by a judicious regulation of
the fire, and a vigilant attendance on the soup-kettle, this may be
accomplished. You shall have a tureen of such soup as will satisfy the
most fastidious palate, and the meat make its appearance at table, at
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> same time, in possession of a full portion of nutritious
succulence.</p>

<p>This requires nothing more than to stew the meat very slowly (instead of
keeping the pot boiling a gallop, as common cooks too commonly do), and
to take it up as soon as it is done enough. See &#8220;Soup and bouilli&#8221; (<a href="#no_238">No.
238</a>), &#8220;Shin of beef stewed&#8221; (<a href="#no_493">No. 493</a>), &#8220;Scotch barley broth&#8221; (<a href="#no_204">No. 204</a>).</p>

<p>Meat cooked in this manner affords much more nourishment than it does
dressed in the common way, is easy of digestion in proportion as it is
tender, and an invigorating, substantial diet, especially valuable to
the poor, whose laborious employments require support.</p>

<p>If they could get good eating put within their reach, they would often
go to the butcher&#8217;s shop, when they now run to the public-house.</p>

<p>Among the variety of schemes that have been suggested for bettering the
condition of the poor, a more useful or extensive charity cannot be
devised, than that of instructing them in economical and comfortable
cookery, except providing them with spectacles.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor in Scotland, and on the Continent, manage much better. Oatmeal
porridge (Nos. <a href="#no_205">205</a> and <a href="#no_572">572</a>) and milk, constitute the breakfast and
supper of those patterns of industry, frugality, and temperance, the
Scottish peasantry.</p>

<p>&#8220;When they can afford meat, they form with it a large quantity of barley
broth (<a href="#no_204">No. 204</a>), with a variety of vegetables, by boiling the whole a
long time, enough to serve the family for several days.</p>

<p>&#8220;When they cannot afford meat, they make broth of barley and other
vegetables, with a lump of butter (see <a href="#no_229">No. 229</a>), all of which they boil
for many hours, and this with oat cakes forms their dinner.&#8221; <span class="smcap">Cochrane&#8217;s</span>
<i>Seaman&#8217;s Guide</i>, p. 34.</p>

<p>The cheapest method of making a nourishing soup is least known to those
who have most need of it. (See <a href="#no_229">No. 229</a>.)</p>

<p>Our neighbours the French are so justly famous for their skill in the
affairs of the kitchen, that the adage says, &#8220;as many Frenchmen as many
cooks:&#8221; surrounded as they are by a profusion of the most delicious
wines and most seducing <i>liqueurs</i>, offering every temptation and
facility to render drunkenness delightful: yet a tippling Frenchman is a
&#8220;<i>rara avis</i>;&#8221; they know how so easily and completely to keep life in
repair by good eating, that they require little or no adjustment from
drinking.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>This accounts for that &#8220;<i>toujours gai</i>,&#8221; and happy equilibrium of
spirits, which they enjoy with more regularity than any people. Their
stomach, being unimpaired by spirituous liquors, embrace and digest
vigorously the food they sagaciously prepare for it, and render easily
assimilable by cooking it sufficiently, wisely contriving to get the
difficult part of the work of the stomach done by fire and water.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>To salt Meat.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_6" id="no_6"></a>No. 6.)</h3>

<p>In the <i>summer</i> season, especially, meat is frequently spoiled by the
cook forgetting to take out the kernels; one in the udder of a round of
beef, in the fat in the middle of the round, those about the thick end
of the flank, &amp;c.: if these are not taken out, all the salt in the world
will not keep the meat.</p>

<p>The art of salting meat is to rub in the salt thoroughly and evenly into
every part, and to fill all the holes full of salt where the kernels
were taken out, and where the butcher&#8217;s skewers were.</p>

<p>A round of beef of 25 pounds will take a pound and a half of salt to be
rubbed in all at first, and requires to be turned and rubbed every day
with the brine; it will be ready for dressing in four or five
days,<a name="FNanchor_111-1_90" id="FNanchor_111-1_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_111-1_90" class="fnanchor">111-*</a> if you do not wish it very salt.</p>

<p>In <i>summer</i>, the sooner meat is salted after it is killed the better;
and care must be taken to defend it from the flies.</p>

<p>In <i>winter</i>, it will eat the shorter and tenderer, if kept a few days
(according to the temperature of the weather) until its fibre has become
short and tender, as these changes do not take place after it has been
acted upon by the salt.</p>

<p>In frosty weather, take care the meat is not frozen, and warm the salt
in a frying-pan. The extremes of heat<a name="FNanchor_111-2_91" id="FNanchor_111-2_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_111-2_91" class="fnanchor">111-&#8224;</a> and cold are equally
unfavourable for the process of salting. In the former, the meat changes
before the salt can affect it: in the latter, it is so hardened, and its
juices are so congealed, that the salt cannot penetrate it.</p>

<p>If you wish it red, rub it first with saltpetre, in the proportion of
half an ounce, and the like quantity of moist sugar, to a pound of
common salt. (See Savoury salt beef, <a href="#no_496">No. 496</a>.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>You may impregnate meat with a very agreeable vegetable flavour, by
pounding some sweet herbs (<a href="#no_459">No. 459</a>,) and an onion with the salt. You may
make it still more relishing by adding a little ZEST (<a href="#no_recipe">No. 255</a>), or
<i>savoury spice</i> (<a href="#no_457">No. 457</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>To pickle Meat.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;Six pounds of salt, one pound of sugar, and four ounces of saltpetre,
boiled with four gallons of water, skimmed, and allowed to cool, forms a
very strong pickle, which will preserve any meat completely immersed in
it. To effect this, which is essential, either a heavy board or a flat
stone must be laid upon the meat. The same pickle may be used
repeatedly, provided it be boiled up occasionally with additional salt
to restore its strength, diminished by the combination of part of the
salt with the meat, and by the dilution of the pickle by the juices of
the meat extracted. By boiling, the albumen, which would cause the
pickle to spoil, is coagulated, and rises in the form of scum, which
must be carefully removed.&#8221;&mdash;See <i>Supplement to Encyclop. Britan.</i> vol.
iv. p. 340.</p>

<p>Meat kept immersed in pickle gains weight. In one experiment by Messrs.
Donkin and Gamble, there was a gain of three per cent., and in another
of two and a half; but in the common way of salting, when the meat is
not immersed in pickle, there is a loss of about one pound, or one and a
half, in sixteen. See Dr. Wilkinson&#8217;s account of the preserving power of
<span class="smrom">PYRO-LIGNEOUS ACID</span>, &amp;c. in the Philosophical Magazine for 1821, No. 273,
p. 12.</p>

<p>An H-bone of 10 or 12 pounds weight will require about three-quarters of
a pound of salt, and an ounce of moist sugar, to be well rubbed into it.
It will be ready in four or five days, if turned and rubbed every day.</p>

<p>The time meat requires salting depends upon the weight of it, and how
much salt is used: and if it be rubbed in with a heavy hand, it will be
ready much sooner than if only lightly rubbed.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-112" id="nb-p-112"></a>N. B. Dry the salt, and rub it with the sugar in a mortar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pork</span> requires a longer time to cure (in proportion to its weight) than
beef. A leg of pork should be in salt eight or ten days; turn it and rub
it every day.</p>

<p>Salt meat should be well washed before it is boiled, especially if it
has been in salt long, that the liquor in which the meat is boiled, may
not be too salt to make soup of. (<a href="#no_218">No. 218</a>, &amp;c. and <a href="#no_555">No. 555</a>.)</p>

<p>If it has been in salt a long time, and you fear that it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> be too
salt, wash it well in cold water, and soak it in lukewarm water for a
couple of hours. If it is <i>very salt</i>, lay it in water the night before
you intend to dress it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>A Round of salted Beef.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_7" id="no_7"></a>No. 7.)</h3>

<p>As this is too large for a moderate family, we shall write directions
for the dressing half a round. Get the tongue side.</p>

<p>Skewer it up tight and round, and tie a fillet of broad tape round it,
to keep the skewers in their places.</p>

<p>Put it into plenty of cold water, and carefully catch the scum as soon
as it rises: let it boil till all the scum is removed, and then put the
boiler on one side of the fire, to keep <i>simmering</i> slowly till it is
done.</p>

<p>Half a round of 15lbs. will take about three hours: if it weighs more,
give it more time.</p>

<p>When you take it up, if any stray scum, &amp;c. sticks to it that has
escaped the vigilance of your skimmer, wash it off with a paste-brush:
garnish the dishes with carrots and turnips. Send up carrots (<a href="#no_129">No. 129</a>),
turnips (<a href="#no_130">No. 130</a>), and parsnips, or greens (<a href="#no_118">No. 118</a>), &amp;c. on separate
dishes. Pease pudding (<a href="#no_555">No. 555</a>), and <span class="smrom">MY PUDDING</span> (<a href="#no_551">No. 551</a>), are all very
proper accompaniments.</p>

<p><a name="nb-7" id="nb-7"></a>N.B. The outside slices, which are generally too much salted and too

<p>Is to be managed in exactly the same manner as the round, but will be
sooner boiled, as it is not so solid. An H-bone of 20lbs. will be done
enough in about four hours; of 10lbs. in three hours, more or less, as
the weather is hotter or colder. Be sure the boiler is big enough to
allow it plenty of water-room: let it be well covered with water: set
the pot on one side of the fire to boil gently: if it boils quick at
first, no art can make it tender after. The slower it boils, the better
it will look, and the tenderer it will be. The same accompanying
vegetables as in the preceding receipt. Dress plenty of carrots, as cold
carrots are a general favourite with cold beef.</p>

dress it. Put the head into a saucepan, with plenty of cold water: when
it is coming to a boil, and the scum rises, carefully remove it.</p>

<p>Half a calf&#8217;s head (without the skin) will take from an hour and a half

about an hour longer. It must be <i>stewed very gently</i> till it is tender:
it is then extremely nutritive, and easy of digestion.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Pickled Pork</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_11" id="no_11"></a>No. 11.)</h3>

<p>Takes more time than any other meat. If you buy your pork ready salted,
ask how many days it has been in salt; if many, it will require to be
soaked in water for six hours before you dress it. When you cook it,
wash and scrape it as clean as possible; when delicately dressed, it is
a favourite dish with almost every body. Take care it does not boil
fast; if it does, the knuckle will break to pieces, before the thick
part of the meat is warm through; a leg of seven pounds takes three
hours and a half very slow simmering. Skim your pot very carefully, and
when you take the meat out of the boiler, scrape it clean.</p>

<p>Some sagacious cooks (who remember to how many more nature has given
eyes than she has given tongues and brains), when pork is boiled, score
it in diamonds, and take out every other square; and thus present a
retainer to the eye to plead for them to the palate; but this is
pleasing the eye at the expense of the palate. A leg of nice pork,
nicely salted, and nicely boiled, is as nice a cold relish as cold ham;
especially if, instead of cutting into the middle when hot, and so
letting out its juices, you cut it at the knuckle: slices broiled, as
<a href="#no_487">No. 487</a>, are a good luncheon, or supper. To make pease pudding, and
pease soup extempore, see <a href="#nb-218">N.B.</a> to Nos. <a href="#no_218">218</a> and <a href="#nb-555">555</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span>&mdash;Some persons who sell pork ready salted have a silly trick of
cutting the knuckle in two; we suppose that this is done to save their
salt; but it lets all the gravy out of the leg; and unless you boil your
pork merely for the sake of the pot-liquor, which in this case receives
all the goodness and strength of the meat, friendly reader, your oracle
cautions you to buy no leg of pork which is slit at the knuckle.</p>

<p>If pork is not done enough, nothing is more disagreeable; if too much,
it not only loses its colour and flavour, but its substance becomes soft
like a jelly.</p>

<p>It must never appear at table without a good pease pudding (see <a href="#no_555">No.

<p>Put a thin slice of bacon at the bottom of a stew-pan with some broth, a
blade of mace, a few pepper-corns, and a bit of thyme; boil the feet
till they are quite tender; this will take full twenty minutes; but the
heart, liver, and lights will be done enough in ten, when they are to be
taken out, and minced fine.</p>

<p>Put them all together into a stew-pan with some gravy; thicken it with a
little butter rolled in flour; season it with a little pepper and salt,
and set it over a gentle fire to simmer for five minutes, frequently
shaking them about.</p>

<p>While this is doing, have a thin slice of bread toasted very lightly;
divide it into sippets, and lay them round the dish: pour the mince and
sauce into the middle of it, and split the feet, and lay them round it.</p>

<p><a name="nb-12" id="nb-12"></a>N.B. Pettitoes are sometimes boiled and dipped in batter, and fried a
light brown.</p>

<p><a name="obs-12" id="obs-12"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;If you have no gravy, put into the water you stew the pettitoes
in an onion, a sprig of lemon thyme, or sweet marjoram, with a blade of
bruised mace, a few black peppers, and a large tea-spoonful of mushroom
catchup (<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), and you will have a very tolerable substitute for
gravy. A bit of <a href="#no_252">No. 252</a> will be a very great improvement to it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Bacon.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_13" id="no_13"></a>No. 13.)</h3>

<p>Cover a pound of nice streaked bacon (as the Hampshire housewives say,
that &#8220;has been starved one day, and fed another&#8221;) with cold water, let
it boil gently for three-quarters of an hour; take it up, scrape the
under-side well, and cut off the rind: grate a crust of bread not only
on the top, but all over it, as directed for the ham in the following
receipt, and put it before the fire for a few minutes: it must not be
there too long, or it will dry it and spoil it.</p>

<p>Two pounds will require about an hour and a half, according to its
thickness; the hock or gammon being very thick, will take more.</p>

<p><a name="obs-13" id="obs-13"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;See Nos. <a href="#no_526">526</a> and <a href="#no_527">527</a>: when only a little bacon is wanted, these
are the best ways of dressing it.</p>

<p>The boiling of bacon is a very simple subject to comment, upon; but our
main object is to teach common cooks the art of dressing common food in
the best manner.</p>

<p>Bacon is sometimes as salt as salt can make it, therefore before it is
boiled it must be soaked in warm water for an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> hour or two, changing the
water once; then pare off the rusty and smoked part, trim it nicely on
the under side, and scrape the rind as clean as possible.</p>

<p><a name="mem_13" id="mem_13"></a><span class="smcap">Mem.</span>&mdash;Bacon is an extravagant article in housekeeping; there is often
twice as much dressed as need be: when it is sent to table as an
accompaniment to boiled poultry or veal, a pound and a half is plenty
for a dozen people. A good German sausage is a very economical
substitute for bacon; or fried pork sausages (<a href="#no_87">No. 87</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><a name="corr33" id="corr33"></a><i>Ham</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_14" id="no_14"></a>No. 14.)</h3>

<p>Though of the bacon kind, has been so altered and hardened in the
curing, that it requires still more care.</p>

<p>Ham is generally not half-soaked; as salt as brine, and hard as flint;
and it would puzzle the stomach of an ostrich to digest it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span>&mdash;The salt, seasoning, and smoke, which preserve it before it is
eaten, prevent its solution after; and unless it be very long and very
gently stewed, the strongest stomach will have a tough job to extract
any nourishment from it. If it is a very dry Westphalia ham, it must be
soaked, according to its age and thickness, from 12 to 24 hours; for a
green Yorkshire or Westmoreland ham, from four to eight hours will be
sufficient. Lukewarm water will soften it much sooner than cold, when
sufficiently soaked, trim it nicely on the underside, and pare off all
the rusty and smoked parts till it looks delicately clean.</p>

<p>Give it plenty of water-room, and put it in while the water is cold; let
it heat very gradually, and let it be on the fire an hour and a half
before it comes to a boil; let it be well skimmed, and keep it simmering
very gently: a middling-sized ham of fifteen pounds will be done enough
in about four or five hours, according to its thickness.</p>

<p>If not to be cut till cold, it will cut the shorter and tenderer for
being boiled about half an hour longer. In a very small family, where a
ham will last a week or ten days, it is best economy not to cut it till
it is cold, it will be infinitely more juicy.</p>

<p>Pull off the skin carefully, and preserve it as whole as possible; it
will form an excellent covering to keep the ham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> moist; when you have
removed the skin, rub some bread raspings through a hair-sieve, or grate
a crust of bread; put it into the perforated cover of the dredging-box,
and shake it over it, or glaze it; trim the knuckle with a fringe of cut
writing-paper. You may garnish with spinage or turnips, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Tongue.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_15" id="no_15"></a>No. 15.)</h3>

<p>A tongue is so hard, whether prepared by drying or pickling, that it
requires much more cooking than a ham; nothing of its weight takes so
long to dress it properly.</p>

<p>A tongue that has been salted and dried should be put to soak (if it is
old and very hard, 24 hours before it is wanted) in plenty of water; a
green one fresh from the pickle requires soaking only a few hours: put
your tongue into plenty of cold water; let it be an hour gradually
warming; and give it from three and a half to four hours&#8217; very slow
simmering, according to the size, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="obs-15" id="obs-15"></a><i>Obs.</i> When you choose a tongue, endeavour to learn how long it has been
dried or pickled, pick out the plumpest, and that which has the
smoothest skin, which denotes its being young and tender.</p>

<p>Turkeys (especially large ones) should not be dressed till they have

<p>Turkeys, and large fowls, should have the strings or sinews of the

<p>Truss them with the legs outward, they are much easier carved.</p>

<p>Poultry must be well washed in warm water; if very dirty from the
singeing, &amp;c. rub them with a little white soap; but thoroughly rinse it
off, before you put them into the pot.</p>

<p>Make a good and clear fire; set on a clean pot, with pure and clean
water, enough to well cover the turkey, &amp;c.; the slower it boils, the
whiter and plumper it will be. When there rises any scum, remove it; the
common method of some (who are more nice than wise) is to wrap them up
in a cloth, to prevent the scum attaching to them; which, if it does, by
your neglecting to skim the pot, there is no getting it off afterward,
and the poulterer is blamed for the fault of the cook.</p>

<p>If there be water enough, and it is attentively skimmed, the fowl will
both look and eat much better this way than when it has been covered up
in the cleanest cloth, and the colour and flavour of your poultry will
be preserved in the most delicate perfection.</p>

<p>Truss your rabbits short, lay them in a basin of warm water for ten

hour; if large ones, three quarters; if very old, an hour: smother them
with plenty of white onion sauce (<a href="#no_298">No. 298</a>), mince the liver, and lay it

<p>At all events, cut off the head before you send it to table, we hardly

<p>If the tripe has been prepared as it usually is at the tripe shops, it

<p>Make some onion sauce in the same manner as you do for rabbits (<a href="#no_298">No.

onions you can get; peel them before you boil them; when they are

<p>When you have kept two or three ribs of beef till quite tender, take out
the bones, and skewer it as round as possible (like a fillet of veal):
before they roll it, some cooks egg it, and sprinkle it with veal
stuffing (<a href="#no_374">No. 374</a>). As the meat is more in a solid mass, it will require
more time at the fire than in the preceding receipt; a piece of ten or
twelve pounds weight will not be well and thoroughly roasted in less
than four and a half or five hours.</p>

<p>For the first half hour, it should not be less than twelve inches from
the fire, that it may get gradually warm to the centre: the last half
hour before it will be finished, sprinkle a little salt over it; and if
you wish to froth it, flour it, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(<i>i. e.</i> the two loins) of ten or eleven pounds, two hours and a half:
it is the business of the butcher to take off the skin and skewer it on
again, to defend the meat from extreme heat, and preserve its
succulence; if this is neglected, tie a sheet of paper over it (baste
the strings you tie it on with directly, or they will burn): about a
quarter of an hour before you think it will be done, take off the skin
or paper, that it may get a pale brown colour, then baste it and flour
it lightly to froth it. We like <a href="#no_346">No. 346</a> for sauce.</p>

<p>Take a neck of good four or five years old Southdown wether mutton, cut
long in the bones; let it hang (in temperate weather) at least a week:
two days before you dress it, take allspice and black pepper, ground and
pounded fine, a quarter of an ounce each; rub them together, and then
rub your mutton well with this mixture twice a day. When you dress it,
wash off the spice with warm water, and roast in paste, as we have
ordered the haunch of venison. (<a href="#no_63">No. 63</a>).</p>

<p><a name="obs-32" id="obs-32"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Persevering and ingenious epicures have invented many methods to
give mutton the flavour of venison. Some say that mutton, prepared as

meat has been fuddled and rubbed with) will perhaps still protest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
against &#8220;Welch venison;&#8221; and indeed we do not understand by what
conjuration allspice and claret can communicate the flavour of venison
to mutton. We confess our fears that the flavour of venison (especially
of its fat) is inimitable; but believe you may procure prime
eight-toothed wether mutton, keep it the proper time, and send it to
table with the accompaniments (Nos. <a href="#no_346">346</a> and <a href="#no_347">347</a>, &amp;c.) usually given to

take an hour and a half roasting.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>A Bacon Spare-Rib</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_53" id="no_53"></a>No. 53.)</h3>

<p>Usually weighs about eight or nine pounds, and will take from two to
three hours to roast it thoroughly; not exactly according to its weight,
but the thickness of the meat upon it, which varies very much. Lay the
thick end nearest to the fire.</p>

<p>A proper bald spare-rib of eight pounds weight (so called because almost
all the meat is pared off), with a steady fire, will be done in an hour
and a quarter. There is so little meat on a bald spare-rib, that if you
have a large, fierce fire, it will be burned before it is warm through.
Joint it nicely, and crack the ribs across as you do ribs of lamb.</p>

<p>When you put it down to roast, dust on some flour, and baste it with a
little butter; dry a dozen sage leaves, and rub them through a
hair-sieve, and put them into the top of a pepper-box; and about a
quarter of an hour before the meat is done, baste it with butter; dust
the pulverized sage, or the savoury powder in <a href="#no_51">No. 51</a>; or sprinkle with
duck stuffing (<a href="#no_61">No. 61</a>).</p>

<p><a name="obs-53" id="obs-53"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Make it a general rule never to pour gravy over any thing that

insipid.</p>

<p>Some people carve a spare-rib by cutting out in slices the thick part at
the bottom of the bones. When this meat is cut away, the bones may be
easily separated, and are esteemed very sweet picking.</p>

<p>Apple sauce (<a href="#no_304">No. 304</a>), mashed potatoes (<a href="#no_106">No. 106</a>), and good mustard (<a href="#no_370">No.

hour longer.</p>

<p>Stuff it with duck stuffing (<a href="#no_378">No. 378</a>). Score the skin in stripes, about
a quarter of an inch apart, and rub it with salad oil, as directed in

<p>Is in prime order for the spit when about three weeks old.</p>

<p>It loses part of its goodness every hour after it is killed; if not
quite fresh, no art can make the crackling crisp.</p>

<p>To be in perfection, it should be killed in the morning to be eaten at
dinner: it requires very careful roasting. A sucking-pig, like a young
child, must not be left for an instant.</p>

<p>The ends must have much more fire than the middle: for this purpose is
contrived an iron to hang before the middle part, called a pig-iron. If
you have not this, use a common flat iron, or keep the fire fiercest at
the two ends.</p>

<p>For the stuffing, take of the crumb of a stale loaf about five ounces;
rub it through a colander; mince fine a handful of sage (<i>i. e.</i> about
two ounces), and a large onion (about an ounce and a half<a name="FNanchor_133-2_103" id="FNanchor_133-2_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_133-2_103" class="fnanchor">133-&#8224;</a>). Mix
these together with an egg, some pepper and salt, and a bit of butter as
big as an egg. Fill the belly of the pig with this, and sew it up: lay
it to the fire, and baste it with salad oil till it is quite done. Do
not leave it a moment: it requires the most vigilant attendance.</p>

<p>Roast it at a clear, brisk fire at some distance. To gain the praise of
epicurean pig-eaters, the crackling must be nicely crisped and
delicately lightly browned, without being either blistered or burnt.</p>

<p>A small, three weeks old pig will be done enough<a name="FNanchor_133-3_104" id="FNanchor_133-3_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_133-3_104" class="fnanchor">133-&#8225;</a> in about an
hour and a half.</p>

<p>Before you take it from the fire, cut off the head, and part that and
the body down the middle: chop the brains very fine, with some boiled
sage leaves, and mix them with good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> veal gravy, made as directed in <a href="#no_192">No.
192</a>, or beef gravy (<a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>), or what runs from the pig when you cut its
head off. Send up a tureenful of gravy (<a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>) besides. Currant sauce
is still a favourite with some of the old school.</p>

<p>Lay your pig back to back in the dish, with one half of the head on each
side, and the ears one at each end, which you must take care to make
nice and crisp; or you will get scolded, and deservedly, as the silly
fellow was who bought his wife a pig with only one ear.</p>

<p>When you cut off the pettitoes, leave the skin long round the ends of
the legs. When you first lay the pig before the fire, rub it all over
with fresh butter or salad oil: ten minutes after, and the skin looks
dry; dredge it well with flour all over, let it remain on an hour, then
rub it off with a soft cloth.</p>

<p><a name="nb-56" id="nb-56"></a>N. B. A pig is a very troublesome subject to roast; most persons have
them baked. Send a quarter of a pound of butter, and beg the baker to
baste it well.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Turkey, Turkey Poults, and other Poultry.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_57" id="no_57"></a>No. 57.)</h3>

<p>A fowl and a turkey require the same management at the fire, only the
latter will take longer time.</p>

<p>Many a Christmas dinner has been spoiled by the turkey having been hung
up in a cold larder, and becoming thoroughly frozen; <i>Jack Frost</i> has
ruined the reputation of many a turkey-roaster: therefore, in very cold
weather, remember the note in the 5th page of the <a href="#CHAPTER_III">3d chapter</a> of the
Rudiments of Cookery.</p>

<p>Let them be carefully picked, &amp;c. and break the breast-bone (to make
them look plump), twist up a sheet of clean writing-paper, light it, and
thoroughly singe the turkey all over, turning it about over the flame.</p>

<p>Turkeys, fowls, and capons have a much better appearance, if, instead of
trussing them with the legs close together, and the feet cut off, the
legs are extended on each side of the bird, and the toes only cut off
with a skewer through each foot, to keep them at a proper distance.</p>

<p>Be careful, when you draw it, to preserve the liver, and not to break
the gall-bag, as no washing will take off the bitter taste it gives,
where it once touches.</p>

<p>Prepare a nice, clear, brisk fire for it.</p>

<p>Make stuffing according to <a href="#no_374">No. 374</a>, or <a href="#no_recipe">376</a>; stuff it under the breast,
where the craw was taken out, and make some into balls, and boil or fry
them, and lay them round the dish; they are handy to help, and you can
then reserve some of the inside stuffing to eat with the cold turkey, or
to enrich a hash (<a href="#no_533">No. 533</a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>Score the gizzard, dip it into the yelk of an egg or melted butter, and
sprinkle it with salt and a few grains of Cayenne; put it under one
pinion and the liver under the other; cover the liver with buttered
paper, to prevent it from getting hardened or burnt.</p>

<p>When you first put a turkey down to roast, dredge it with flour; then
put about an ounce of butter into a basting-ladle, and as it melts,
baste the bird therewith.</p>

<p>Keep it at a distance from the fire for the first half hour, that it may
warm gradually; then put it nearer, and when it is plumped up, and the
steam draws in towards the fire, it is nearly enough; then dredge it
lightly with flour, and put a bit of butter into your basting-ladle, and
as it melts, baste the turkey with it; this will raise a finer froth
than can be produced by using the fat out of the pan.</p>

<p>A very large turkey will require about three hours to roast it
thoroughly; a middling-sized one, of eight or ten pounds (which is far
nicer eating than the very large one), about two hours; a small one may
be done in an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Turkey poults are of various sizes, and will take about an hour and a
half; they should be trussed, with their legs twisted under like a duck,
and the head under the wing like a pheasant.</p>

<p>Fried pork sausages (<a href="#no_87">No. 87</a>) are a very savoury and favourite
accompaniment to either roasted or boiled poultry. A turkey thus
garnished is called &#8220;an alderman in chains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sausage-meat is sometimes used as stuffing, instead of the ordinary
forcemeat. (<a href="#no_recipe">No. 376</a>, &amp;c.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span> If you wish a turkey, especially a very large one, to be tender,
never dress it till at least four or five days (in cold weather, eight
or ten) after it has been killed. &#8220;No man who understands good living
will say, on such a day I will eat that turkey; but will hang it up by
four of the large tail-feathers, and when, on paying his morning visit
to the larder, he finds it lying upon a cloth prepared to receive it
when it falls, that day let it be cooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hen turkeys are preferable to cocks for whiteness and tenderness, and
the small fleshy ones with black legs are most esteemed.</p>

<p>Send up with them oyster (<a href="#no_278">No. 278</a>), egg (<a href="#no_267">No. 267</a>), bread (<a href="#no_221">No. 221</a>), and
plenty of gravy sauce (<a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>). To hash turkey, <a href="#no_533">No. 533</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span> Some epicures are very fond of the gizzard and rump, peppered and
salted, and broiled. (See <a href="#no_538">No. 538</a>, &#8220;how to dress a devil with <i>v&eacute;ritable

<p>Must be killed a couple of days in moderate, and more in cold weather,
before they are dressed, or they will eat tough: a good criterion of the
ripeness of poultry for the spit, is the ease with which you can then
pull out the feathers; when a fowl is plucked, leave a few to help you
to ascertain this.</p>

<p>They are managed exactly in the same manner, and sent up with the same
sauces as a turkey, only they require proportionably less time at the
fire.</p>

<p>A full-grown five-toed fowl, about an hour and a quarter.</p>

<p>A moderate-sized one, an hour.</p>

<p>A chicken, from thirty to forty minutes.</p>

<p>Here, also, pork sausages fried (<a href="#no_87">No. 87</a>) are in general a favourite
accompaniment, or turkey stuffing; see forcemeats (Nos. <a href="#no_374">374</a>, <a href="#no_375">5</a>, <a href="#no_recipe">6</a>, and
<a href="#no_377">7</a>); put in plenty of it, so as to plump out the fowl, which must be tied
closely (both at the neck and rump), to keep in the stuffing.</p>

<p>Some cooks put the liver of the fowl into this forcemeat, and others
mince it and pound it, and rub it up with flour and melted butter (<a href="#no_287">No.
287</a>).</p>

<p>When the bird is stuffed and trussed, score the gizzard nicely, dip it
into melted butter, let it drain, and then season it with Cayenne and
salt; put it under one pinion, and the liver under the other; to prevent
their getting hardened or scorched, cover them with double paper
buttered.</p>

<p>Take care that your roasted poultry be well browned; it is as
indispensable that roasted poultry should have a rich brown complexion,
as boiled poultry should have a delicate white one.</p>

<p><a name="obs-58" id="obs-58"></a><i>Obs.</i> &#8220;The art of fattening poultry for the market is a considerable
branch of rural economy in some convenient situations, and consists in
supplying them with plenty of healthy food, and confining them; and
ducks and geese must be prevented from going into water, which prevents
them from becoming fat, and they also thereby acquire a rancid, fishy
taste. They are put into a dark place, and crammed with a paste made of
barley meal, mutton-suet, and some treacle or coarse sugar mixed with
milk, and are found to be completely ripe in a fortnight. If kept
longer, the fever that is induced by this continued state of repletion
renders them red and unsaleable, and frequently kills them.&#8221; But
exercise is as indispensable to the health of poultry as other
creatures; without it, the fat will be all accumulated in the cellular
membrane, instead of being dispersed through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> its system. See <span class="smcap">Moubray</span>
<i>on breeding and fattening domestic Poultry</i>, 12mo. 1819.</p>

<p>Fowls which are fattened artificially are by some epicures preferred to
those called barn-door fowls; whom we have heard say, that they should
as soon think of ordering a barn-door for dinner as a barn-door fowl.</p>

<p>The age of poultry makes all the difference: nothing is tenderer than a
young chicken; few things are tougher than an old cock or hen, which is
only fit to make broth. The meridian of perfection of poultry is just
before they have come to their full growth, before they have begun to
harden.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Goose.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_59" id="no_59"></a>No. 59.)</h3>

very fine, adding four ounces, <i>i. e.</i> about a large breakfast-cupful of
stale bread-crumbs, a bit of butter about as big as a walnut, and a very
little pepper and salt (to this some cooks add half the liver,<a name="FNanchor_137-2_106" id="FNanchor_137-2_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_137-2_106" class="fnanchor">137-&#8224;</a>

little room for the stuffing to swell; spit it, tie it on the spit at
both ends, to prevent its swinging round, and to keep the stuffing from
coming out. From an hour and a half to an hour and three-quarters, will
roast a fine full-grown goose. Send up gravy and apple sauce with it

concern, that one person annually feeds for market upwards of 5000.&#8221; &#8220;A
goose on a farm in Scotland, two years since, of the clearly ascertained
age of 89 years, healthy and vigorous, was killed by a sow while sitting
over her eggs; it was supposed she might have lived many years, and her
fecundity appeared to be permanent. Other geese have been proved to
reach the age of 70 years.&#8221; <span class="smcap">Moubray</span> <i>on Poultry</i>, p. 40.</p>

<p>It appears in Dr. <span class="smcap">Stark&#8217;s</span> <i>Experiments on Diet</i>, p. 110, that &#8220;when he
fed upon roasted goose, he was more vigorous both in body and mind than

<p>The goose at Michaelmas is as famous in the mouths of the million, as
the minced-pie at Christmas; but for those who eat with delicacy, it is
by that time too full-grown.</p>

<p>The true period when the goose is in its highest perfection, is when it
has just acquired its full growth, and not begun to harden. If the March
goose is insipid, the Michaelmas goose is rank; the fine time is between
both, from the second week in June to the first in September: the leg is
not the most tender part of a goose. See Mock Goose (<a href="#no_51">No. 51</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Green Goose.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_60" id="no_60"></a>No. 60.)</h3>

<p>Geese are called green till they are about four months old.</p>

<p>The only difference between roasting these and a full-grown goose,
consists in seasoning it with pepper and salt instead of sage and onion,
and roasting it for forty or fifty minutes only.</p>

<p><a name="obs-60" id="obs-60"></a><i>Obs.</i> This is one of the least desirable of those insipid premature

<p>Mind your duck is well cleaned, and wiped out with a clean cloth: for
the stuffing, take an ounce of onion and half an ounce of green sage;
chop them very fine, and mix them with two ounces, <i>i. e.</i> about a
breakfast-cupful, of bread-crumbs, a bit of butter about as big as a
walnut, a very little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> black pepper and salt, (some obtuse palates may
require warming with a little Cayenne, <a href="#no_404">No. 404</a>,) and the yelk of an egg
to bind it; mix these thoroughly together, and put into the duck. For
another stuffing, see <a href="#no_378">No. 378</a>. From half to three-quarters of an hour
will be enough to roast it, according to the size: contrive to have the
feet delicately crisp, as some people are very fond of them; to do this
nicely you must have a sharp fire. For sauce, green pease (<a href="#no_134">No. 134</a>),
bonne bouche (<a href="#no_341">No. 341</a>), gravy sauce (<a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>), and sage and onion sauce

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Haunch of Venison.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_63" id="no_63"></a>No. 63.)</h3>

<p>To preserve the fat, make a paste of flour and water, as much as will
cover the haunch; wipe it with a dry cloth in every part; rub a large
sheet of paper all over with butter, and cover the venison with it; then
roll out the paste about three-quarters of an inch thick; lay this all
over the fat side, and cover it well with three or four sheets of strong
white paper, and tie it securely on with packthread: have a strong,
close fire, and baste your venison as soon as you lay it down to roast
(to prevent the paper and string from burning); it must be well basted
all the time.</p>

<p>A buck haunch generally weighs from 20 to 25 pounds; will take about
four hours and a half roasting in warm, and longer in cold weather: a
haunch of from 19 to 18 pounds will be done in about three or three and
a half.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour before it is done, the string must be cut, and the
paste carefully taken off; now baste it with butter, dredge it lightly
with flour, and when the froth rises, and it has got a very light brown
colour, garnish the knuckle-bone with a ruffle of cut writing-paper, and
send it up, with good, strong (but unseasoned) gravy (<a href="#no_347">No. 347</a>) in one

but they are better eating when of the size of a house lamb, and are
then roasted in quarters; the hind-quarter is most esteemed.</p>

<p>They must be put down to a very quick fire, and either basted all the
time they are roasting, or be covered with sheets of fat bacon; when
done, baste it with butter, and dredge it with a little salt and flour,
till you make a nice froth on it.</p>

<p>The first points of consideration are, how old is the hare? and how long
has it been killed? When young, it is easy of digestion, and very
nourishing; when old, the contrary in every respect.</p>

<p>To ascertain the age, examine the first joint of the forefoot; you will
find a small knob, if it is a leveret, which disappears as it grows
older; then examine the ears, if they tear easily, it will eat tender;
if they are tough, so will be the hare, which we advise you to make into
soup (<a href="#no_241">No. 241</a>), or stew or jug it (<a href="#no_523">No. 523</a>).</p>

<p>When newly killed, the body is stiff; as it grows stale, it becomes
limp.</p>

<p>As soon as you receive a hare, take out the liver, parboil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> it, and keep
it for the stuffing; some are very fond of it. Do not use it if it be
not quite fresh and good. Some mince it, and send it up as a garnish in
little hillocks round the dish. Wipe the hare quite dry, rub the inside
with pepper, and hang it up in a dry, cool place.</p>

cold water four or five hours, changing the water two or three times;
lay it in a clean cloth, and dry it well, then truss it.</p>

<p>To make the stuffing, see <a href="#no_379">No. 379</a>. Do not make it too thin; it should be
of cohesive consistence: if it is not sufficiently stiff, it is good for
nothing. Put this into the belly, and sew it up tight.</p>

<p>Cut the neck-skin to let the blood out, or it will never appear to be
done enough; spit it, and baste it with drippings,<a name="FNanchor_141-2_108" id="FNanchor_141-2_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_141-2_108" class="fnanchor">141-&#8224;</a> (or the juices
of the back will be dried up before the upper joints of the legs are
half done,) till you think it is nearly done, which a middling-sized
hare will be in about an hour and a quarter. When it is almost roasted
enough, put a little bit of butter into your basting-ladle, and baste it
with this, and flour it, and froth it nicely.</p>

<p>Serve it with good gravy (<a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>, or <a href="#no_347">No. 347</a>), and currant-jelly. For
another stuffing, see receipt <a href="#no_379">No. 379</a>. Some cooks cut off the head and
divide it, and lay one half on each side the hare.</p>

<p>Cold roast hare will make excellent soup (<a href="#no_241">No. 241</a>), chopped to pieces,
and stewed in three quarts of water for a couple of hours; the stuffing
will be a very agreeable substitute for sweet herbs and seasoning. See

forty a full-grown rabbit.</p>

<p>When you lay it down, baste it with butter, and dredge it lightly and
carefully with flour, that you may have it frothy, and of a fine light
brown. While the rabbit is roasting, boil its liver<a name="FNanchor_142-1_109" id="FNanchor_142-1_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_142-1_109" class="fnanchor">142-*</a> with some

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Pheasant.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_68" id="no_68"></a>No. 68.)</h3>

<p>Requires a smart fire, but not a fierce one. Thirty minutes will roast a
young bird, and forty or fifty a full-grown pheasant. Pick and draw it,
cut a slit in the back of the neck, and take out the craw, but don&#8217;t cut
the head off; wipe the inside of the bird with a clean cloth, twist the
legs close to the body, leave the feet on, but cut the toes off; don&#8217;t
turn the head under the wing, but truss it like a fowl, it is much
easier to carve; baste it, butter and froth it, and prepare sauce for it
(Nos. <a href="#no_321">321</a> and <a href="#no_329">329</a>). See the instructions in receipts to roast fowls and

<p><a name="obs-68" id="obs-68"></a><i>Obs.</i> We believe the rarity of this bird is its best recommendation;
and the character given it by an ingenious French author is just as good
as it deserves. &#8220;Its flesh is naturally tough, and owes all its
tenderness and succulence to the long time it is kept before it is
cooked;&#8221; until it is &#8220;<i>bien mortifi&eacute;e</i>,&#8221; it is uneatable<a name="FNanchor_142-2_110" id="FNanchor_142-2_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_142-2_110" class="fnanchor">142-&#8224;</a>.
Therefore, instead of &#8220;<i>sus per col</i>,&#8221; suspend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> it by one of the long
tail-feathers, and the pheasant&#8217;s falling from it is the criterion of
its ripeness and readiness for the spit.</p>

<p>Our president of the committee of taste (who is indefatigable in his
endeavours to improve the health, as well as promote the enjoyment, of
his fellow-students in the school of good living, and to whom the
epicure, the economist, and the valetudinarian are equally indebted for
his careful revision of this work, and especially for introducing that
salutary maxim into the kitchen, that &#8220;the salubrious is ever a superior
consideration to the savoury,&#8221; and indeed, the rational epicure only
relishes the latter when entirely subordinate to the former), has
suggested to us, that the detachment of the feather cannot take place
until the body of the bird has advanced more than one degree beyond the
state of wholesome <i>haut-go&ucirc;t</i>, and become &#8220;<i>trop mortifi&eacute;e</i>;&#8221; and that
to enjoy this game in perfection, you must have a brace of birds killed
the same day; these are to be put in suspense as above directed, and
when one of them <i>drops</i>, the hour is come that the spit should be
introduced to his companion:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Mock Pheasant.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_69" id="no_69"></a>No. 69.)</h3>

<p>If you have only one pheasant, and wish for a companion for it, get a
fine young fowl, of as near as may be the same size as the bird to be
matched, and make game of it by trussing it like a pheasant, and
dressing it according to the above directions. Few persons will discover
the pheasant from the fowl, especially if the latter has been kept four
or five days.</p>

<p>The peculiar flavour of the pheasant (like that of other game) is
principally acquired by long keeping.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Wild Ducks.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_74" id="no_74"></a>No. 74.)</h3>

<p>For roasting a wild duck, you must have a clear, brisk fire, and a hot
spit; it must be browned upon the outside, without being sodden within.
To have it well frothed and full of gravy is the nicety. Prepare the
fire by stirring and raking it just before the bird is laid down, and
fifteen or twenty minutes will do it in the fashionable way; but if you
like it a little more done, allow it a few minutes longer; if it is too
much, it will lose its flavour.</p>

<p>Woodcocks should not be drawn, as the trail is by the lovers of &#8220;<i>haut

body, and run an iron skewer through each thigh, close to the body, and
tie them on a small bird spit; put them to roast at a clear fire; cut as
many slices of bread as you have birds, toast or fry them a delicate
brown, and lay them in the dripping-pan under the birds to catch the

gravy into the dish, and send some up in a boat, see <a href="#obs-329"><i>Obs.</i></a> to <a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>:
twenty or thirty minutes will roast them. Garnish with slices of lemon.</p>

<p><a name="obs-76" id="obs-76"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Some epicures like this bird very much under-done, and direct
that a woodcock should be just introduced to the cook, for her to show

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Pigeons.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_78" id="no_78"></a>No. 78.)</h3>

<p>When the pigeons are ready for roasting, if you are desired to stuff
them, chop some green parsley very fine, the liver, and a bit of butter
together, with a little pepper and salt, or with the stuffing ordered
for a fillet of veal (<a href="#no_374">No. 374</a> or <a href="#no_375">No. 375</a>), and fill the belly of each
bird with it. They will be done enough in about twenty or thirty
minutes; send up parsley and butter (<a href="#no_261">No. 261</a>,) in the dish under them,
and some in a boat, and garnish with crisp parsley (<a href="#no_318">No. 318</a>), or fried
bread crumbs (<a href="#no_320">No. 320</a>), or bread sauce (<a href="#no_321">No. 321</a>), or gravy (<a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>).</p>

<p><a name="obs-78" id="obs-78"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;When pigeons are fresh they have their full relish; but it goes
entirely off with a very little keeping; nor is it in any way so well
preserved as by roasting them: when they are put into a pie they are
generally baked to rags, and taste more of pepper and salt than of any
thing else.</p>

<p>A little melted butter may be put into the dish with them, and the gravy
that runs from them will mix with it into fine sauce. Pigeons are in the
greatest perfection from midsummer to Michaelmas; there is then the most
plentiful and best food for them; and their finest growth is just when
they are full feathered. When they are in the pen-feathers, they are
flabby; when they are full grown, and have flown some time, they are
tough. Game and poultry are best when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> have just done growing, <i>i.
e.</i> as soon as nature has perfected her work.</p>

<p>This was the secret of Solomon, the famous pigeon-feeder of Turnham
Green, who is celebrated by the poet Gay, when he says,</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Larks and other small Birds.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_80" id="no_80"></a>No. 80.)</h3>

<p>These delicate little birds are in high season in November. When they
are picked, gutted, and cleaned, truss them; brush them with the yelk of
an egg, and then roll them in bread-crumbs: spit them on a lark-spit,
and tie that on to a larger spit; ten or fifteen minutes at a quick fire
will do them enough; baste them with fresh butter while they are
roasting, and sprinkle them with bread-crumbs till they are well covered
with them.</p>

<p>For the sauce, fry some grated bread in clarified butter, see <a href="#no_259">No. 259</a>,
and set it to drain before the fire, that it may harden: serve the
crumbs under the larks when you dish them, and garnish them with slices

more desirable to roast away the fat than to preserve it. If the
honourable societies of agriculturists, at the time they consulted a
learned professor about the composition of manures, had consulted some
competent authority on the nature of animal substances, the public might
have escaped the overgrown corpulency of the animal flesh, which every
where fills the markets.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Domestic Management</i>, 12mo. 1813, p. 182.</p>

<p>&#8220;Game, and other wild animals proper for food, are of very superior
qualities to the tame, from the total contrast of the circumstances
attending them. They have a free range of exercise in the open air, and
choose their own food, the good effects of which are very evident in a
short, delicate texture of flesh, found only in them. Their juices and
flavour are more pure, and their <i>fat</i>, when it is in any degree, as in
venison, and some other instances, differs as much from that of our
<i>fatted</i> animals, as silver and gold from the grosser metals. The
superiority of <span class="smcap">Welch mutton</span> and <span class="smcap">Scotch Beef</span> is owing to a similar
cause.&#8221;&mdash;<a name="corr38" id="corr38"></a><i>Ibid.</i>, p. 150.</p>

<p>If there is more <span class="smrom">FAT</span> than you think will be eaten with the meat; cut it
off; it will make an excellent <span class="smrom">PUDDING</span> (<a href="#no_554">No. 554</a>); or clarify it, (<a href="#no_84">No.

thoroughly, and use a moderate fire for roasting, the fat need not be
covered with paper.</p>

lingual nerves of the good folks of Great Britain, the livers of poultry
are considered a very high relish by our continental neighbours; and the
following directions how to procure them in perfection, we copy from the
recipe of &#8220;<i>un Vieil Amateur de Bonne Ch&egrave;re</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The liver of a duck, or a goose, which has submitted to the rules and
orders that men of taste have invented for the amusement of his
sebaceous glands, is a superlative exquisite to the palate of a Parisian
epicure; but, alas! the poor goose, to produce this darling dainty, must
endure sad torments. He must be crammed with meat, deprived of drink,
and kept constantly before a hot fire: a miserable martyrdom indeed! and
would be truly intolerable if his reflections on the consequences of his
sufferings did not afford him some consolation; but the glorious
prospect of the delightful growth of his liver gives him courage and
support; and when he thinks how speedily it will become almost as big as
his body, how high it will rank on the list of double relishes, and with
what ecstasies it will be eaten by the fanciers &#8220;<i>des Foies gras</i>,&#8221; he
submits to his destiny without a sigh. The famous <i>Strasburg pies</i> are
made with livers thus prepared, and sell for an enormous price.&#8221;</p>

<p>However incredible this <i>ordonnance</i> for the obesitation of a goose&#8217;s
liver may appear at first sight, will it not seem equally so to
after-ages, that in this enlightened country, in 1821, we encouraged a
folly as much greater, as its operation was more universal? Will it be
believed, that it was then considered the <i>acme</i> of perfection in beef
and mutton, that it should be so <i>over</i>-fattened, that a poor man, to
obtain one pound of meat that he could eat, must purchase another which
he could not, unless converted into a suet pudding: moreover, that the
highest premiums were annually awarded to those who produced sheep and
oxen in the most extreme stale of <i>morbid obesity</i>?!!</p>

<p>Instead of washing, a &#8220;<i>grand Cuisinier</i>&#8221; says, it is much better to

<p>Cut the steaks rather thinner than for broiling. Put some butter, or <a href="#no_83">No.

keep turning them till they are done enough. For sauce, see <a href="#no_356">No. 356</a>, and

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Sausages</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_87" id="no_87"></a>No. 87.)</h3>

<p>Are best when quite fresh made. Put a bit of butter, or dripping (<a href="#no_83">No.
83</a>), into a clean frying-pan; as soon as it is melted (before it gets
hot) put in the sausages, and shake the pan for a minute, and keep
turning them (be careful not to break or prick them in so doing); fry
them over a very slow fire till they are nicely browned on all sides;
when they are done, lay them on a hair-sieve, placed before the fire for
a couple of minutes to drain the fat from them. The secret of frying
sausages is, to let them get hot very gradually; they then will not
burst, if they are not stale.</p>

<p>The common practice to prevent their bursting, is to prick them with a
fork; but this lets the gravy out.</p>

<p>You may froth them by rubbing them with cold fresh butter, and lightly
dredge them with flour, and put them in a cheese-toaster or Dutch oven
for a minute.</p>

<p>Some over-economical cooks insist that no butter or lard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> &amp;c. is
required, their own fat being sufficient to fry them: we have tried it;

putting the trimmings into a stew-pan with a little soft water, an
onion, a roll of lemon-peel, a blade of mace, a sprig of thyme and
parsley, and a bay leaf; stew over a slow fire an hour, then strain it;

us, she has ascertained from actual experiments, that &#8220;the <i>drippings</i>
of roast meat, combined with wheat flour, oatmeal, barley, pease, or
potato-starch, will make delicious soup, agreeable and savoury to the
palate, and nutritive and serviceable to the stomach; and that while a
joint is roasting, good soup may be made from the drippings of the <span class="smrom">FAT</span>,
which is the <i>essence of meat</i>, as seeds are of vegetables, and
impregnates <span class="smrom">SOUP</span> <i>with the identical taste of meat</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Writers on cookery give strict directions to carefully <i>skim off the
fat</i>, and in the next sentence order butter (a much more expensive
article) to be added: instead of this, when any fat appears at the top
of your soup or stew, <i>do not skim it</i> off, but unite it with the broth
by means of the vegetable mucilages, flour, oatmeal, ground barley, or
potato-starch; when suspended the soup is equally agreeable to the
palate nutritive to the stomach,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cooks bestow a great deal of pains to make gravies; they stew and boil
lean meat for hours, and, after all, their cookery tastes more of pepper
and salt than any thing else. If they would add the bulk of a chesnut of
solid fat to a common-sized sauce-boatful of gravy, it will give it more
sapidity than twenty hours&#8217; stewing lean meat would, unless a larger
quantity was used than is warranted by the rules of frugality.&#8221; See Nos.
<a href="#no_205">205</a> and <a href="#no_229">229</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The experiments of <i>Dr. Stark</i> on the nourishing powers of different
substances, go very far to prove that three ounces of the fat of boiled
beef are equal to a pound of the lean. <i>Dr. Pages</i>, the traveller,
confirms this opinion: &#8216;Being obliged,&#8217; says he, &#8216;during the journey
from North to South America by land, to live solely on animal food, I
experienced the truth of what is observed by hunters, who live solely on
animal food, viz. that besides their receiving little nourishment from
the leaner parts of it, it soon becomes offensive to the taste; whereas
the fat is both more nutritive, and continues to be agreeable to the
palate. To many stomachs fat is unpleasant and indigestible, especially
when converted into oil by heat; this may be easily prevented, by the
simple process of combining the fat completely with water, by the
intervention of vegetable mucilage, as in melting butter, by means of
flour, the butter and water are united into a homogeneous fluid.&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;From

<p>Those who are nice about steaks, never attempt to have them, except in
weather which permits the meat to be hung till it is tender, and give
the butcher some days&#8217; notice of their wish for them.</p>

<p>If, friendly reader, you wish to entertain your mouth with a superlative
beef-steak, you must have the inside of the sirloin cut into steaks. The
next best steaks are those cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> from the middle of a rump, that has been
killed at least four days in moderate weather, and much longer in cold
weather, when they can be cut about six inches long, four inches wide,
and half an inch thick: do not beat them, which vulgar trick breaks the
cells in which the gravy of the meat is contained, and it becomes dry
and tasteless.</p>

<p><a name="nb-94" id="nb-94"></a>N.B. If your butcher sends steaks which are not tender, we do not insist
that you should object to let him be beaten.</p>

<p>Desire the butcher to cut them of even thickness; if he does not, divide
the thicker from the thinner pieces, and give them time accordingly.</p>

<p>Take care to have a very clear, brisk fire; throw a little salt on it;
make the gridiron hot, and set it slanting, to prevent the fat from
dropping into the fire, and making a smoke. It requires more practice
and care than is generally supposed to do steaks to a nicety; and for
want of these little attentions, this very common dish, which every body
is supposed capable of dressing, seldom comes to table in perfection.</p>

<p>Ask those you cook for, if they like it under, or thoroughly done; and
what accompaniments they like best; it is usual to put a table-spoonful
of catchup (<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), or a little minced eschalot, or <a href="#no_402">No. 402</a>, into a
dish before the fire; while you are broiling, turn the steak, &amp;c. with a
pair of steak-tongs, it will be done in about ten or fifteen minutes;
rub a bit of butter over it, and send it up garnished with pickles and
finely-scraped horse-radish. Nos. <a href="#no_135">135</a>, <a href="#no_278">278</a>, <a href="#no_299">299</a>, <a href="#no_recipe">255</a>, <a href="#no_402">402</a>, <a href="#no_423">423</a>, <a href="#no_439">439</a>, and

curling on the gridiron, so that they may be evenly broiled.</p>

<p>Broil them over a very clear fire, turning them often till they are
done; they will take about ten or twelve minutes, if the fire is brisk:
or fry them in butter, and make gravy for them in the pan (after you
have taken out the kidneys), by putting in a tea-spoonful of flour; as
soon as it looks brown, put in as much water as will make gravy; they
will take five minutes more to fry than to broil. For sauce, Nos. <a href="#no_318">318</a>,

<p>Pick and truss it the same as for boiling, cut it open down the back,
wipe the inside clean with a cloth, season it with a little pepper and
salt, have a clear fire, and set the gridiron at a good distance over
it, lay the chicken on with the inside towards the fire (you may egg it

brown: take care the fleshy side is not burned. Lay it on a hot dish;
pickled mushrooms, or mushroom sauce (<a href="#no_305">No. 305</a>), thrown over it, or

pigeons are trussed as for boiling, flat them with a cleaver, taking
care not to break the skin of the backs or breasts. Season them with
pepper and salt, a little bit of butter, and a tea-spoonful of water,
and tie them close at both ends; so that when they are brought to table,
they bring their sauce with them. Egg and dredge them well with grated
bread (mixed with spice and sweet herbs, if you please); then lay them
on the gridiron, and turn them frequently: if your fire is not very
clear, lay them on a sheet of paper well buttered, to keep them from
getting smoked. They are much better broiled whole.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Sixteen Ways of dressing Potatoes.</i><a name="FNanchor_155-1_116" id="FNanchor_155-1_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_155-1_116" class="fnanchor">155-*</a>&mdash;(<a name="no_102" id="no_102"></a>No. 102.)</h3>

<p>The vegetable kingdom affords no food more wholesome, more easily
procured, easily prepared, or less expensive, than the potato: yet,
although this most useful vegetable is dressed almost every day, in
almost every family, for one plate of potatoes that comes to table as it
should, ten are spoiled.</p>

<p>Be careful in your choice of potatoes: no vegetable varies so much in
colour, size, shape, consistence, and flavour.</p>

<p>The reddish-coloured are better than the white, but the
yellowish-looking ones are the best. Choose those of a moderate size,
free from blemishes, and fresh, and buy them in the mould. They must not
be wetted till they are cleaned to be cooked. Protect them from the air
and frost, by laying them in heaps in a cellar, covering them with mats,
or burying them in sand or in earth. The action of frost is most
destructive: if it be considerable, the life of the vegetable is
destroyed, and the potato speedily rots.</p>

<p>Wash them, but do not pare or cut them, unless they are very large. Fill
a sauce-pan half full of potatoes of equal size<a name="FNanchor_155-2_117" id="FNanchor_155-2_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_155-2_117" class="fnanchor">155-&#8224;</a> (or make them so
by dividing the larger ones), put to them as much cold water as will
cover them about an inch: they are sooner boiled, and more savoury, than
when drowned in water. Most boiled things are spoiled by having too
little water, but potatoes are often spoiled by too much: they must
merely be covered, and a little allowed for waste in boiling, so that
they may be just covered at the finish.</p>

<p>Set them on a moderate fire till they boil; then take them off, and put
them by the side of the fire to simmer slowly till they are soft enough
to admit a fork (place no dependence on the usual test of their skins&#8217;
cracking, which, if they are boiled fast, will happen to some potatoes
when they are not half done, and the insides quite hard). Then pour the
water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> off (if you let the potatoes remain in the water a moment after
they are done enough, they will become waxy and watery), uncover the
sauce-pan, and set it at such a distance from the fire as will secure it
from burning; their superfluous moisture will evaporate, and the
potatoes will be perfectly dry and mealy.</p>

<p>You may afterward place a napkin, folded up to the size of the
sauce-pan&#8217;s diameter, over the potatoes, to keep them hot and mealy till
wanted.</p>

<p><a name="obs-102" id="obs-102"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;This method of managing potatoes is in every respect equal to
steaming them; and they are dressed in half the time.</p>

<p>There is such an infinite variety of sorts and sizes of potatoes, that
it is impossible to say how long they will take doing: the best way is
to try them with a fork. Moderate-sized potatoes will generally be done
enough in fifteen or twenty minutes. See <a href="#obs-106"><i>Obs.</i></a> to <a href="#no_106">No. 106</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cold Potatoes fried.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_102-1" id="no_102-1"></a>No. 102*.)</h3>

<p>Put a bit of clean dripping into a frying-pan: when it is melted, slice
in your potatoes with a little pepper and salt; put them on the fire;
keep stirring them: when they are quite hot, they are ready.</p>

<p><a name="obs-102-1" id="obs-102-1"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;This is a very good way of re-dressing potatoes, or see <a href="#no_106">No. 106</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potatoes boiled and broiled.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_103" id="no_103"></a>No. 103.)</h3>

<p>Dress your potatoes as before directed, and put them on a gridiron over
a very clear and brisk fire: turn them till they are brown all over, and
send them up dry, with melted butter in a cup.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_104" id="no_104"></a>No. 104.)</h3>

<p>Peel large potatoes; slice them about a quarter of an inch thick, or cut
them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them
well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping. Take care that
your fat and frying-pan are quite clean; put it on a quick fire, watch
it, and as soon as the lard boils, and is still, put in the slices of
potato, and keep moving them till they are crisp. Take them up, and lay
them to drain on a sieve: send them up with a very little salt sprinkled
over them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potatoes fried whole.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_105" id="no_105"></a>No. 105.)</h3>

<p>When nearly boiled enough, as directed in <a href="#no_102">No. 102</a>, put them into a
stew-pan with a bit of butter, or some nice clean beef-drippings; shake
them about often (for fear of burning them), till they are brown and
crisp; drain them from the fat.</p>

<p><a name="obs-105" id="obs-105"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;It will be an elegant improvement to the last three receipts,
previous to frying or broiling the potatoes, to flour them and dip them
in the yelk of an egg, and then roll them in fine-sifted bread-crumbs;
they will then deserve to be called <span class="smrom">POTATOES FULL DRESSED</span>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potatoes mashed.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_106" id="no_106"></a>No. 106. See also <a href="#no_112">No. 112</a>.)</h3>

<p>When your potatoes are thoroughly boiled, drain them quite dry, pick out
every speck, &amp;c., and while hot, rub them through a colander into a
clean stew-pan. To a pound of potatoes put about half an ounce of
butter, and a table-spoonful of milk: do not make them too moist; mix
them well together.</p>

<p><a name="obs-106" id="obs-106"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;After Lady-day, when the potatoes are getting old and specky,
and in frosty weather, this is the best way of dressing them. You may
put them into shapes or small tea-cups; egg them with yelk of egg, and
brown them very slightly before a slow fire. See <a href="#no_108">No. 108</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potatoes mashed with Onions.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_107" id="no_107"></a>No. 107.)</h3>

<p>Prepare some boiled onions by putting them through a sieve, and mix them
with potatoes. In proportioning the onions to the potatoes, you will be
guided by your wish to have more or less of their flavour.</p>

<p><a name="obs-107" id="obs-107"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;See <a href="#FNanchor_343-1_247">note</a> under <a href="#no_555">No. 555</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potatoes <a name="corr41" id="corr41"></a>escalloped.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_108" id="no_108"></a>No. 108.)</h3>

<p>Mash potatoes as directed in <a href="#no_106">No. 106</a>; then butter some nice clean
scollop-shells, patty-pans, or tea-cups or saucers; put in your
potatoes; make them smooth at the top; cross a knife over them; strew a
few fine bread-crumbs on them; sprinkle them with a paste-brush with a
few drops of melted butter, and then set them in a Dutch oven; when they
are browned on the top, take them carefully out of the shells and brown
the other side.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Colcannon.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_108-1" id="no_108-1"></a>No. 108*.)</h3>

<p>Boil potatoes and greens, or spinage, separately; mash the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> potatoes;
squeeze the greens dry; chop them quite fine, and mix them with the
potatoes, with a little butter, pepper, and salt; put it into a mould,
buttering it well first; let it stand in a hot oven for ten minutes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potatoes roasted.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_109" id="no_109"></a>No. 109.)</h3>

<p>Wash and dry your potatoes (all of a size), and put them in a tin Dutch
oven, or cheese-toaster: take care not to put them too near the fire, or
they will get burned on the outside before they are warmed through.</p>

<p>Large potatoes will require two hours to roast them.</p>

<p><a name="nb-109" id="nb-109"></a>N.B. To save time and trouble, some cooks half boil them first.</p>

<p>This is one of the best opportunities the <span class="smrom">BAKER</span> has to rival the cook.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potatoes roasted under Meat.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_110" id="no_110"></a>No. 110.)</h3>

<p>Half boil large potatoes, drain the water from them, and put them into
an earthen dish, or small tin pan, under meat that is roasting, and
baste them with some of the dripping: when they are browned on one side,
turn them and brown the other; send them up round the meat, or in a
small dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potato Balls.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_111" id="no_111"></a>No. 111.)</h3>

<p>Mix mashed potatoes with the yelk of an egg; roll them into balls; flour
them, or egg and bread-crumb them; and fry them in clean drippings, or
brown them in a Dutch oven.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potato Balls Rago&ucirc;t</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_112" id="no_112"></a>No. 112.)</h3>

<p>Are made by adding to a pound of potatoes a quarter of a pound of grated
ham, or some sweet herbs, or chopped parsley, an onion or eschalot,
salt, pepper, and a little grated nutmeg, or other spice, with the yelk
of a couple of eggs: they are then to be dressed as <a href="#no_111">No. 111</a>.</p>

<p><a name="obs-112" id="obs-112"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;An agreeable vegetable relish, and a good supper-dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potato Snow.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_114" id="no_114"></a>No. 114.)</h3>

<p>The potatoes must be free from spots, and the whitest you can pick out;
put them on in cold water; when they begin to crack strain the water
from them, and put them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> into a clean stew-pan by the side of the fire
till they are quite dry, and fall to pieces; rub them through a wire
sieve on the dish they are to be sent up in, and do not disturb them
afterward.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Potato Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_115" id="no_115"></a>No. 115.)</h3>

<p>Peel and slice your potatoes very thin into a pie-dish; between each
layer of potatoes put a little chopped onion (three-quarters of an ounce
of onion is sufficient for a pound of potatoes); between each layer
sprinkle a little pepper and salt; put in a little water, and cut about
two ounces of fresh butter into little bits, and lay them on the top:
cover it close with puff paste. It will take about an hour and a half to
bake it.</p>

<p><a name="nb-115" id="nb-115"></a>N.B. The yelks of four eggs (boiled hard) may be added; and when baked,
a table-spoonful of good mushroom catchup poured in through a funnel.</p>

<p><a name="obs-115" id="obs-115"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Cauliflowers divided into mouthfuls, and button onions, seasoned
with curry powder, &amp;c. make a favourite vegetable pie.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>New Potatoes.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_116" id="no_116"></a>No. 116.)</h3>

<p>The best way to clean new potatoes is to rub them with a coarse cloth or
flannel, a or scrubbing-brush, and proceed as in <a href="#no_102">No. 102</a>.</p>

<p><a name="nb-116" id="nb-116"></a>N.B. New potatoes are poor, watery, and insipid, till they are full two
inches in diameter: they are not worth the trouble of boiling before

<p><a name="obs-116" id="obs-116"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Some cooks prepare sauces to pour over potatoes, made with
butter, salt, and pepper, or gravy, or melted butter and catchup; or
stew the potatoes in ale, or water seasoned with pepper and salt; or
bake them with herrings or sprats, mixed with layers of potatoes,
seasoned with pepper, salt, sweet herbs, vinegar, and water; or cut
mutton or beef into slices, and lay them in a stew-pan, and on them
potatoes and spices, then another layer of the meat alternately, pouring
in a little water, covering it up very close, and slewing slowly.</p>

for potatoes.</p>

<p><a name="nb-117" id="nb-117"></a>N.B. They should be covered with thick melted butter, or a nice white or
brown sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cabbage.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_118" id="no_118"></a>No. 118.)</h3>

<p>Pick cabbages very clean, and wash them thoroughly; then look them over
carefully again; quarter them if they are very large. Put them into a
sauce-pan with plenty of boiling water; if any scum rises, take it off;
put a large spoonful of salt into the sauce-pan, and boil them till the
stalks feel tender. A young cabbage will take about twenty minutes or
half an hour; when full grown, near an hour: see that they are well
covered with water all the time, and that no smoke or dirt arises from
stirring the fire. With careful management, they will look as beautiful
when dressed as they did when growing.</p>

<p><a name="obs-118" id="obs-118"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Some cooks say, that it will much ameliorate the flavour of
strong old cabbages to boil them in two waters; <i>i. e.</i> when they are
half done, to take them out, and put them directly into another
sauce-pan of boiling water, instead of continuing them in the water into
which they were first put.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Savoys</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_120" id="no_120"></a>No. 120.)</h3>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Sprouts and young Greens.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_121" id="no_121"></a>No. 121.)</h3>

<p>The receipt we have written for cabbages will answer as well for
sprouts, only they will be boiled enough in fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Spinage.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_122" id="no_122"></a>No. 122.)</h3>

<p>Spinage should be picked a leaf at a time, and washed in three or four
waters; when perfectly clean, lay it on a sieve or colander, to drain
the water from it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>Put a sauce-pan on the fire three parts filled with water, and large
enough for the spinage to float in it; put a small handful of salt in
it; let it boil; skim it, and then put in the spinage; make it boil as
quick as possible till quite tender, pressing the spinage down
frequently that it may be done equally; it will be done enough in about
ten minutes, if boiled in plenty of water: if the spinage is a little
old, give it a few minutes longer. When done, strain it on the back of a
sieve; squeeze it dry with a plate, or between two trenchers; chop it
fine, and put it into a stew-pan with a bit of butter and a little salt:
a little cream is a great improvement, or instead of either some rich
gravy. Spread it in a dish, and score it into squares of proper size to
help at table.</p>

<p><a name="obs-122" id="obs-122"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Grated nutmeg, or mace, and a little lemon-juice, is a favourite
addition with some cooks, and is added when you stir it up in the
stew-pan with the butter garnished. Spinage is frequently served with
poached eggs and fried bread.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Asparagus.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_123" id="no_123"></a>No. 123.)</h3>

<p>Set a stew-pan with plenty of water in it on the fire; sprinkle a
handful of salt in it; let it boil, and skim it; then put in your
asparagus, prepared thus: scrape all the stalks till they are perfectly
clean; throw them into a pan of cold water as you scrape them; when they
are all done, tie them up in little bundles, of about a quarter of a
hundred each, with bass, if you can get it, or tape (string cuts them to
pieces); cut off the stalks at the bottom that they may be all of a
length, leaving only just enough to serve as a handle for the green
part; when they are tender at the stalk, which will be in from twenty to
thirty minutes, they are done enough. Great care must be taken to watch
the exact time of their becoming tender; take them up just at that
instant, and they will have their true flavour and colour: a minute or
two more boiling destroys both.</p>

<p>While the asparagus is boiling, toast a round of a quartern loaf, about
half an inch thick; brown it delicately on both sides; dip it lightly in
the liquor the asparagus was boiled in, and lay it in the middle of a
dish: melt some butter (<a href="#no_256">No. 256</a>); then lay in the asparagus upon the
toast, which must project beyond the asparagus, that the company may see
there is a toast.</p>

<p>Pour no butter over them, but send some up in a boat, or white sauce
(<a href="#no_364-2">No. 2 of No. 364</a>).</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Sea Kale</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_124" id="no_124"></a>No. 124.)</h3>

<p>Is tied up in bundles, and dressed in the same way as asparagus.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cauliflower.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_125" id="no_125"></a>No. 125.)</h3>

<p>Choose those that are close and white, and of the middle size; trim off
the outside leaves; cut the stalk off flat at the bottom; let them lie
in salt and water an hour before you boil them.</p>

<p>Put them into boiling water with a handful of salt in it; skim it well,
and let it boil slowly till done, which a small one will be in fifteen,
a large one in about twenty minutes; take it up the moment it is enough,
a minute or two longer boiling will spoil it.</p>

<p><a name="nb-125" id="nb-125"></a>N.B. Cold cauliflowers and French beans, carrots and turnips, boiled so
as to eat rather crisp, are sometimes dressed as a salad (<a href="#no_372">No. 372</a> or
<a href="#no_453">453</a>).</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Broccoli.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_126" id="no_126"></a>No. 126.)</h3>

<p>Set a pan of clean cold water on the table, and a saucepan on the fire
with plenty of water, and a handful of salt in it.</p>

<p>Broccoli is prepared by stripping off all the side shoots, leaving the
top; peel off the skin of the stalk with a knife; cut it close off at
the bottom, and put it into the pan of cold water.</p>

<p>When the water in the stew-pan boils, and the broccoli is ready, put it
in; let it boil briskly till the stalks feel tender, from ten to twenty
minutes; take it up with a slice, that you may not break it; let it
drain, and serve up.</p>

<p>If some of the heads of broccoli are much bigger than the others, put
them on to boil first, so that they may get all done together.</p>

<p><a name="obs-126" id="obs-126"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;It makes a nice supper-dish served upon a toast, like asparagus.
It is a very delicate vegetable, and you must take it up the moment it
is done, and send it to table hot.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Red Beet-roots</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_127" id="no_127"></a>No. 127.)</h3>

<p>Are not so much used as they deserve; they are dressed in the same way
as parsnips, only neither scraped nor cut till after they are boiled;
they will take from an hour and a half to three hours in boiling,
according to their size: to be sent to table with salt fish, boiled
beef, &amp;c. When young, large,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> and juicy, it is a very good variety, an
excellent garnish, and easily converted into a very cheap and pleasant
pickle.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Parsnips</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_128" id="no_128"></a>No. 128.)</h3>

<p>Are to be cooked just in the same manner as carrots. They require more
or less time according to their size; therefore match them in size: and
you must try them by thrusting a fork into them as they are in the
water; when that goes easily through, they are done enough. Boil them
from an hour to two hours, according to their size and freshness.</p>

<p><a name="obs-128" id="obs-128"></a><i>Obs.</i> Parsnips are sometimes sent up mashed in the same way as turnips,
and some cooks quarter them before they boil them.<a name="FNanchor_163-1_119" id="FNanchor_163-1_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_163-1_119" class="fnanchor">163-*</a></p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Carrots.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_129" id="no_129"></a>No. 129.)</h3>

<p>Let them be well washed and brushed, not scraped. An hour is enough for
young spring carrots; grown carrots must be cut in half, and will take
from an hour and a half to two hours and a half. When done, rub off the
peels with a clean coarse cloth, and slice them in two or four,
according to their size. The best way to try if they are done enough, is
to pierce them with a fork.</p>

<p><a name="obs-129" id="obs-129"></a><i>Obs.</i> Many people are fond of cold carrot with cold beef; ask if you
shall cook enough for some to be left to send up with the cold meat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Turnips.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_130" id="no_130"></a>No. 130.)</h3>

<p>Peel off half an inch of the stringy outside. Full-grown turnips will
take about an hour and a half gentle boiling; if you slice them, which
most people do, they will be done sooner; try them with a fork; when
tender, take them up, and lay them on a sieve till the water is
thoroughly drained from them. Send them up whole; do not slice them.</p>

<p><a name="nb-130" id="nb-130"></a>N.B. To very young turnips leave about two inches of the green top. See
<a href="#no_132">No. 132</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>To mash Turnips.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_131" id="no_131"></a>No. 131.)</h3>

<p>When they are boiled quite tender, squeeze them as dry as possible
between two trenchers; put them into a saucepan; mash them with a wooden
spoon, and rub them through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> a colander; add a little bit of butter;
keep stirring them till the butter is melted and well mixed with them,
and they are ready for table.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Turnip-tops</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_132" id="no_132"></a>No. 132.)</h3>

<p>Are the shoots which grow out (in the spring) of the old turnip-roots.
Put them into cold water an hour before they are to be dressed; the more
water they are boiled in, the better they will look; if boiled in a
small quantity of water they will taste bitter: when the water boils,
put in a small handful of salt, and then your vegetables; if fresh and
young, they will be done in about twenty minutes; drain them on the back
of a sieve.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>French Beans.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_133" id="no_133"></a>No. 133.)</h3>

<p>Cut off the stalk end first, and then turn to the point and strip off
the strings. If not quite fresh, have a bowl of spring-water, with a
little salt dissolved in it, standing before you, and as the beans are
cleaned and stringed, throw them in. When all are done, put them on the
fire in boiling water, with some salt in it; after they have boiled
fifteen or twenty minutes, take one out and taste it; as soon as they
are tender take them up; throw them into a colander or sieve to drain.</p>

<p>To send up the beans whole is much the best method when they are thus
young, and their delicate flavour and colour are much better preserved.
When a little more grown, they must be cut across in two after
stringing; and for common tables they are split, and divided across; cut
them all the same length; but those who are nice never have them at such
a growth as to require splitting.</p>

<p>When they are very large they look pretty cut into lozenges.</p>

<p><a name="obs-133" id="obs-133"></a><i>Obs.</i> See <a href="#nb-125">N.B.</a> to <a href="#no_125">No. 125</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Green Pease.</i><a name="FNanchor_164-1_120" id="FNanchor_164-1_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_164-1_120" class="fnanchor">164-*</a>&mdash;(<a name="no_134" id="no_134"></a>No. 134.)</h3>

<p>Young green pease, well dressed, are among the most delicious delicacies
of the vegetable kingdom. They must be young; it is equally
indispensable that they be fresh gathered, and cooked as soon as they
are shelled for they soon lose both their colour and sweetness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>If you wish to feast upon pease in perfection, you must have them
gathered the same day they are dressed, and put on to boil within half
an hour after they are shelled.</p>

<p>Pass them through a riddle, <i>i. e.</i> a coarse sieve, which is made for
the purpose of separating them. This precaution is necessary, for large
and small pease cannot be boiled together, as the former will take more
time than the latter.</p>

<p>For a peck of pease, set on a sauce-pan with a gallon of water in it;
when it boils, put in your pease, with a table-spoonful of salt; skim it
well, keep them boiling quick from twenty to thirty minutes, according
to their age and size. The best way to judge of their being done enough,
and indeed the only way to make sure of cooking them to, and not beyond,
the point of perfection, or, as pea-eaters say, of &#8220;boiling them to a
bubble,&#8221; is to take them out with a spoon and taste them.</p>

<p>When they are done enough, drain them on a hair-sieve. If you like them
buttered, put them into a pie-dish, divide some butter into small bits,
and lay them on the pease; put another dish over them, and turn them
over and over; this will melt the butter through them; but as all people
do not like buttered pease, you had better send them to table plain, as
they come out of the sauce-pan, with melted butter (<a href="#no_256">No. 256</a>) in a
sauce-tureen. It is usual to boil some mint with the pease; but if you
wish to garnish the pease with mint, boil a few sprigs in a sauce-pan by
themselves. See Sage and Onion Sauce (<a href="#no_300">No. 300</a>), and Pea Powder (<a href="#no_458">No.
458</a>); to boil Bacon (<a href="#no_13">No. 13</a>), Slices of Ham and Bacon (<a href="#no_526">No. 526</a>), and
Relishing Rashers of Bacon (<a href="#no_527">No. 527</a>).</p>

<p><a name="nb-134" id="nb-134"></a>N.B. A peck of young pease will not yield more than enough for a couple
of hearty pea-eaters; when the pods are full, it may serve for three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span> Never think of purchasing pease ready-shelled, for the cogent
reasons assigned in the first part of this receipt.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cucumbers stewed.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_135" id="no_135"></a>No. 135.)</h3>

<p>Peel and cut cucumbers in quarters, take out the seeds, and lay them on
a cloth to drain off the water: when they are dry, flour and fry them in
fresh butter; let the butter be quite hot before you put in the
cucumbers; fry them till they are brown, then take them out with an
egg-slice, and lay them on a sieve to drain the fat from them (some
cooks fry sliced onions, or some small button onions, with them, till
they are a delicate light-brown colour, drain them from the fat, and
then put them into a stew-pan with as much gravy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> as will cover them):
stew slowly till they are tender; take out the cucumbers with a slice,
thicken the gravy with flour and butter, give it a boil up, season it
with pepper and salt, and put in the cucumbers; as soon as they are
warm, they are ready.</p>

<p>The above, rubbed through a tamis, or fine sieve, will be entitled to be
called &#8220;cucumber sauce.&#8221; See <a href="#no_399">No. 399</a>, Cucumber Vinegar. This is a very
favourite sauce with lamb or mutton-cutlets, stewed rump-steaks, &amp;c.
&amp;c.: when made for the latter, a third part of sliced onion is sometimes
fried with the cucumber.<a name="FNanchor_166-1_121" id="FNanchor_166-1_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_166-1_121" class="fnanchor">166-*</a></p>

<p>Soak them in cold water, wash them well, then put them into plenty of
boiling water, with a handful of salt, and let them boil gently till
they are tender, which will take an hour and a half, or two hours: the
surest way to know when they are done enough, is to draw out a leaf;
trim them and drain them on a sieve; and send up melted butter with
them, which some put into small cups, so that each guest may have one.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Stewed Onions.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_137" id="no_137"></a>No. 137.)</h3>

<p>The large Portugal onions are the best: take off the top-coats of half a
dozen of these (taking care not to cut off the tops or tails too near,
or the onions will go to pieces), and put them into a stew-pan broad
enough to hold them without laying them atop of one another, and just
cover them with good broth.</p>

<p>Put them over a slow fire, and let them simmer about two hours; when you
dish them, turn them upside down, and pour the sauce over.</p>

<p>Those who desire to see this subject elaborately illustrated, we refer

London, 1699.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>Mr. E. gives us &#8220;an account of seventy-two herbs proper and fit to make
sallet with;&#8221; and a table of thirty-five, telling their seasons and
proportions. &#8220;In the composure of a sallet, every plant should come in
to bear its part, like the notes in music: thus the comical Master Cook
introduced by Damoxenus, when asked, &#8216;what harmony there was in meats?&#8217;
&#8216;the very same,&#8217; says he, &#8216;as the 3d, 5th, and 8th have to one another
in music: the main skill lies in this, not to mingle&#8217; (&#8216;<i>sapores minim&egrave;
consentientes</i>&#8217;). &#8216;Tastes not well joined, inelegant,&#8217; as our Paradisian
bard directs Eve, when dressing a sallet for her angelical guest, in
<span class="smcap">Milton&#8217;s</span> <i>Paradise Lost</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gives the following receipt for the oxoleon:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take of clear and perfectly good oyl-olive three parts; of sharpest
vinegar (sweetest of all condiments, for it incites appetite, and causes
hunger, which is the best sauce), limon, or juice of orange, one part;
and therein let steep some slices of horseradish, with a little salt.
Some, in a separate vinegar, gently bruise a pod of Ginny pepper, and
strain it to the other; then add as much mustard as will lie upon a
half-crown piece. Beat and mingle these well together with the yelk of
two new-laid eggs boiled hard, and pour it over your sallet, stirring it
well together. The super-curious insist that the knife with which sallet
herb is cut must be of silver. Some who are husbands of their oyl, pour
at first the oyl alone, as more apt to communicate and diffuse its
slipperiness, than when it is mingled and beaten with the acids, which
they pour on last of all; and it is incredible how small a quantity of
oyl thus applied is sufficient to imbue a very plentiful assembly of
sallet herbs.&#8221;</p>

are a most luscious article, and so rich and savoury that a small
quantity will suffice.</p>

<p>The ordinary method of cutting cucumbers into slices with raw onions,
served up in vinegar, and seasoned with salt and pepper, is most vulgar
and most unwholesome. In their season they are cheap and plenty; and as
they are crude and unripe they require the stomach of an ostrich to
digest them. They cause much sickness in their season, creating
choleras, cramps, and dysenteries. If stewed or boiled as above
directed, they would be more nutritious and wholesome. A.</p>

good, it is at once firm and tender, and abounds with rich gelatinous
nutriment.</p>

<p>An hour or two before you dress it, soak it in spring-water with some
salt in it, then score the skin across the thickest part of the back, to
prevent its breaking on the breast, which will happen from the fish
swelling, and cracking the skin, if this precaution be not used. Put a
large handful of salt into a fish-kettle with cold water, lay your fish
on a fish-strainer, put it in, and when it is coming to a boil, skim it
well; then set the kettle on the side of the fire, to boil as gently as
possible for about fifteen or twenty minutes (if it boils fast, the fish
will break to pieces); supposing it a middling-sized turbot, and to
weigh eight or nine pounds.</p>

<p>Rub a little of the inside red coral spawn of the lobster through a hair
sieve, without butter; and when the turbot is dished, sprinkle the spawn
over it. Garnish the dish with sprigs of curled parsley, sliced lemon,
and finely-scraped horseradish.</p>

<p>If you like to send it to table in full dress, surround it with
nicely-fried smelts (<a href="#no_173">No. 173</a>), gudgeons are often used for this purpose,
and may be bought very cheap when smelts are very dear; lay the largest
opposite the broadest part of the turbot, so that they may form a
well-proportioned fringe for it; or oysters (<a href="#no_recipe">No. 183*</a>); or cut a sole in
strips, crossways, about the size of a smelt; fry them as directed in
<a href="#no_145">No. 145</a>, and lay them round. Send up lobster sauce (<a href="#no_284">No. 284</a>); two boats
of it, if it is for a large party.</p>

<p>A fine, fresh, thick sole is almost as good eating as a turbot.</p>

<p>Wash and clean it nicely; put it into a fish-kettle with a handful of
salt, and as much cold water as will cover it; set it on the side of the
fire, take off the scum as it rises, and let it boil gently; about five
minutes (according to its size) will be long enough, unless it be very
large. Send it up on a fish-drainer, garnished with slices of lemon and
sprigs of curled parsley, or nicely-fried smelts (<a href="#no_173">No. 173</a>), or oysters
(<a href="#no_183">No. 183</a>).</p>

<p><a name="obs-144" id="obs-144"></a><i>Obs.</i> Slices of lemon are a universally acceptable garnish with either
fried or broiled fish: a few sprigs of crisp parsley may be added, if

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Soles, or other Fish, to fry.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_145" id="no_145"></a>No. 145.)</h3>

<p>Soles are generally to be procured good from some part of the coast, as
some are going out of season, and some coming in, both at the same time;
a great many are brought in well-boats alive, that are caught off Dover
and Folkstone, and some are brought from the same places by
land-carriage. The finest soles are caught off Plymouth, near the
Eddystone, and all the way up the channel, and to Torbay; and frequently
weigh eight or ten pounds per pair: they are generally brought by water
to Portsmouth, and thence by land; but the greatest quantity are caught
off Yarmouth and the Knole, and off the Forelands.</p>

<p>Be sure they are quite fresh, or the cleverest cook cannot make them
either look or eat well.</p>

<p>An hour before you intend to dress them, wash them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> thoroughly, and wrap
them in a clean cloth, to make them perfectly dry, or the bread-crumbs
will not stick to them.</p>

<p>Prepare some bread-crumbs,<a name="FNanchor_170-1_123" id="FNanchor_170-1_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_170-1_123" class="fnanchor">170-*</a> by rubbing some stale bread through a
colander; or, if you wish the fish to appear very delicate and
highly-finished, through a hair-sieve; or use biscuit powder.</p>

<p>Beat the yelk and white of an egg well together, on a plate, with a
fork; flour your fish, to absorb any moisture that may remain, and wipe
it off with a clean cloth; dip them in the egg on both sides all over,
or, what is better, egg them with a paste-brush; put the egg on in an
even degree over the whole fish, or the bread-crumbs will not stick to
it even, and the uneven part will burn to the pan. Strew the
bread-crumbs all over the fish, so that they cover every part, take up
the fish by the head, and shake off the loose crumbs. The fish is now
ready for the frying-pan.</p>

<p>Put a quart or more of fresh sweet olive-oil, or clarified butter (<a href="#no_259">No.
259</a>), dripping (<a href="#no_83">No. 83</a>), lard,<a name="FNanchor_170-2_124" id="FNanchor_170-2_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_170-2_124" class="fnanchor">170-&#8224;</a> or clarified drippings (<a href="#no_83">No. 83</a>);
be sure they are quite sweet and perfectly clean (the fat ought to cover
the fish): what we here order is for soles about ten inches long; if
larger, cut them into pieces the proper size to help at table; this will
save much time and trouble to the carver: when you send them to table,
lay them in the same form they were before they were cut, and you may
strew a little curled parsley over them: they are much easier managed in
the frying-pan, and require less fat: fry the thick part a few minutes
before you put in the thin, you can by this means only fry the thick
part enough, without frying the thin too much. Very large soles should
be boiled (<a href="#no_144">No. 144</a>), or fried in fillets (<a href="#no_147">No. 147</a>). Soles cut in pieces,
crossways, about the size of a smelt, make a very pretty garnish for
stewed fish and boiled fish.</p>

<p>Set the frying-pan over a sharp and clear fire; watch it, skim it with
an egg-slice, and when it boils,<a name="FNanchor_170-3_125" id="FNanchor_170-3_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_170-3_125" class="fnanchor">170-&#8225;</a> <i>i. e.</i> when it has done
bubbling, and the smoke just begins to rise from the surface, put in the
fish: if the fat is not extremely hot, it is impossible to fry fish of a
good colour, or to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> them firm and crisp. (Read the <a href="#CHAPTER_III">3d chapter</a> of
the Rudiments of Cookery.)</p>

<p>The best way to ascertain the heat of the fat, is to try it with a bit
of bread as big as a nut; if it is quite hot enough, the bread will
brown immediately. Put in the fish, and it will be crisp and brown on
the side next the fire, in about four or five minutes; to turn it, stick
a two-pronged fork near the head, and support the tail with a
fish-slice, and fry the other side nearly the same length of time.</p>

<p>Fry one sole at a time, except the pan is very large, and you have
plenty of fat.</p>

<p>When the fish are fried, lay them on a soft cloth (old tablecloths are
best), near enough the fire to keep them warm; turn them every two or
three minutes, till they are quite dry on both sides; this common cooks
commonly neglect. It will take ten or fifteen minutes,<a name="FNanchor_171-1_126" id="FNanchor_171-1_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_171-1_126" class="fnanchor">171-*</a> if the fat
you fried them in was not hot enough; when it is, they want very little
drying. When soles are fried, they will keep very good in a dry place
for three or four days; warm them by hanging them on the hooks in a
Dutch oven, letting them heat very gradually, by putting it some
distance from the fire for about twenty minutes, or in good gravy, as
eels, Wiggy&#8217;s way (Nos. <a href="#no_164">164</a>, <a href="#no_299">299</a>, <a href="#no_337">337</a>, or <a href="#no_356">356</a>).</p>

<p><a name="obs-145" id="obs-145"></a><i>Obs.</i> There are several general rules in this receipt which apply to
all fried fish: we have been very particular and minute in our

otherwise: those persons that like it firm and dry, should have it
crimped; but those that like it tender, should have it plain, and eat it
not earlier than the second day, and if cold weather, three or four days
old it is better: it cannot be kept too long, if perfectly sweet. Young

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cod boiled.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_149" id="no_149"></a>No. 149.)</h3>

<p>Wash and clean the fish, and rub a little salt in the inside of it (if
the weather is very cold, a large cod is the better for being kept a
day): put plenty of water in your fish-kettle, so that the fish may be
well covered; put in a large handful of salt; and when it is dissolved,
put in your fish; a very small fish will require from fifteen to twenty
minutes after the water boils, a large one about half an hour; drain it
on the fish-plate; dish it with a garnish of the roe, liver,
chitterlings, &amp;c. or large native oysters, fried a light brown (see <a href="#no_recipe">No.

trust not to those you buy it of, but taste a bit of one of the flakes;
that which is hard and dry requires two nights&#8217; soaking, changing the
water two or three times; the intermediate day, lay it on a stone floor:
for barrelled cod less time will do; and for the best Dogger-bank split
fish, which has not been more than a fortnight or three weeks in salt,
still less will be needful.</p>

<p>Put it into plenty of cold water, and let it simmer very gently till it

<p>The best mode of dressing this, is to have it cut in thin slices like
veal cutlets, and broiled, and rubbed over with a bit of butter and a
little pepper, and served very hot, and eaten with a squeeze of
lemon-juice. Great care, however, must be taken to cut off the skin
before it is broiled, as the oil in the skin, if burned, imparts a
disgusting flavour to the fish. The flesh is very fine, and comes nearer
to veal, perhaps, than even turtle.</p>

<p>Sturgeon is frequently plentiful and reasonable in the London shops. We
prefer this mode of dressing it to the more savoury one of stewing it in
rich gravy, like carp, &amp;c. which overpowers the peculiar flavour of the

sometimes require a quarter of an hour to drain the fat from them and

<p>Let the fish be well cleaned, and laid in salt for two hours; let the
water drain from them, and then wet them with the pyroligneous acid;
they may be split or not: they are then to be hung in a dry situation
for a day or two, or a week or two, if you please; when broiled, they
have all the flavour of the Findhorn haddock, and will keep sweet for a
long time.</p>

<p>The pyroligneous acid, applied in the same way to beef or mutton, gives
the fine smoke flavour, and may be kept for a considerable length of
time.</p>

<p><i>Scotch way of dressing haddocks.</i>&mdash;A haddock is quite like a different
fish in London and in Edinburgh, which arises<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> chiefly from the manner
in which they are treated: a haddock should never appear at table with
its head and skin on. For boiling, they are all the better for lying a
night in salt; of course they do not take so long to boil without the
skin, and require to be well skimmed to preserve the colour. After lying
in salt for a night, if you hang them up for a day or two, they are very
good broiled and served with cold butter. For frying, they should be
split and boned very carefully, and divided into convenient pieces, if
too large to halve merely; egg and crumb them, and fry in a good deal of
lard; they resemble soles when dressed in this manner. There is another
very delicate mode of dressing them; you split the fish, rub it well
with butter, and do it before the fire in a Dutch oven.</p>

<p>When the fish has been properly washed, lay it in a stew-pan, with half
a pint of claret or port wine, and a quart of good gravy (<a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>); a
large onion, a dozen berries of black pepper, the same of allspice, and
a few cloves, or a bit of mace: cover the fish-kettle close, and let it
stew gently for ten or twenty minutes, according to the thickness of the
fish: take the fish up, lay it on a hot dish, cover it up, and thicken
the liquor it was stewed in with a little flour, and season it with
pepper, salt, essence of anchovy, mushroom catchup, and a little Chili
vinegar; when it has boiled ten minutes, strain it through a tamis, and
pour it over the fish: if there is more sauce than the dish will hold,
send the rest up in a boat.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Maigre Fish Pies.</i></h3>

<p>Salt-fish pie. The thickest part must be chosen, and put in cold water
to soak the night before wanted; then boil it well, take it up, take
away the bones and skin, and if it is good fish it will be in fine
layers; set it on a fish-drainer to get cold: in the mean time, boil
four eggs hard, peel and slice them very thin, the same quantity of
onion sliced thin; line the bottom of a pie-dish with fish forcemeat
(<a href="#no_383">No. 383</a>), or a layer of potatoes sliced thin, then a layer of onions,
then of fish, and of eggs, and so on till the dish is full; season each
layer with a little pepper, then mix a tea-spoonful of made mustard, the
same of essence of anchovy, a little mushroom catchup, in a gill of
water, put it in the dish, then put on the top an ounce of fresh butter
broke in bits; cover it with puff paste, and bake it one hour.</p>

<p>Fresh cod may be done in the same way, by adding a little salt.</p>

<p>All fish for making pies, whether soles, flounders, herrings, salmon,
lobster, eels, trout, tench, &amp;c. should be dressed first; this is the
most economical way for Catholic families,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> as what is boiled one day
will make excellent pies or patties the next.</p>

<p>If you intend it for pies, take the skin off, and the bones out; lay
your salmon, soles, turbot, or codfish, in layers, and season each layer
with equal quantities of pepper, allspice, mace, and salt, till the dish
is full. Save a little of the liquor that the fish was boiled in; set it
on the fire with the bones and skin of the fish, boil it a quarter of an
hour, then strain it through a sieve, let it settle, and pour it in the
dish; cover it with puff-paste; bake it about an hour and a quarter.
Shrimps, prawns, or oysters added, will improve the above; if for
patties, they must be cut in small pieces, and dressed in a <a name="corr43" id="corr43"></a>bechamel
sauce (<a href="#no_364">No. 364</a>).</p>

<p>Cod-sounds for a pie should be soaked at least twenty-four hours, then
well washed, and put on a cloth to dry. Put in a stew-pan two ounces of
fresh butter, with four ounces of sliced onions; fry them of a nice
brown, then put in a small table-spoonful of flour, and add half a pint
of boiling water; when smooth, put in about ten cod-sounds, and season
them with a little pepper, a glass of white wine, a tea-spoonful of
essence of anchovy, the juice of half a lemon; stir it well together,
put it in a pie-dish, cover it with paste, and bake it one hour.</p>

the fish is boiled, lay it slantingly to drain off all the liquor; when
cold, pack it close in the kits, and fill them up with equal parts of
the liquor the salmon was boiled in (having first well skimmed it), and
best vinegar (<a href="#no_24">No. 24</a>); let them rest for a day; fill up again, striking
the sides of the kit with a cooper&#8217;s adze, until the kit will receive no

well washed; put it in, and if it is thick, let it boil very gently.
Salmon requires almost as much boiling as meat; about a quarter of an
hour to a pound of fish: but practice only can perfect the cook in
dressing salmon. A quarter of a salmon will take almost as long boiling
as half a one: you must consider the thickness, not the weight: ten
pounds of fine full-grown salmon will be done in an hour and a quarter.

<p>This fish loses its life as soon as it leaves the sea, and the fresher
it is the better.</p>

<p>Wash and clean them thoroughly (the fishmongers seldom do this
sufficiently), put them into cold water with a handful of salt in it;
let them rather simmer than boil; a small mackerel will be done enough
in about a quarter of an hour; when the eye starts and the tail splits,
they are done; do not let them stand in the water a moment after; they
are so delicate that the heat of the water will break them.</p>

<p>This fish, in London, is rarely fresh enough to appear at table in
perfection; and either the mackerel is boiled too much, or the
roe<a name="FNanchor_183-2_142" id="FNanchor_183-2_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_183-2_142" class="fnanchor">183-&#8224;</a> too little. The best way is to open a slit opposite the
middle of the roe, you can then clean it properly; this will allow the
water access, and the roe will then be done as soon as the fish, which
it seldom is otherwise; some sagacious gourmands insist upon it they
must be taken out and boiled separately. For sauce, see Nos. <a href="#no_263">263</a>, <a href="#no_265">265</a>,

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>N.B. The common notion is, that mackerel are in best condition when
fullest of roe; however, the fish at that time is only valuable for its
roe, the meat of it has scarcely any flavour.</p>

<p>Mackerel generally make their appearance off the Land&#8217;s End about the
beginning of April; and as the weather gets warm they gradually come
round the coast, and generally arrive off Brighton about May, and
continue for some months, until they begin to shoot their spawn.</p>

<p>After they have let go their roes, they are called shotten mackerel, and
are not worth catching; the roe, which was all that was good of them,
being gone.</p>

<p>It is in the early season, when they have least roe, that the flesh of
this fish is in highest perfection. There is also an after-season, when
a few fine large mackerel are taken, (<i>i. e.</i> during the herring season,
about October,) which some piscivorous epicures are very partial to;
these fish having had time to fatten and recover their health, are full
of high flavour, and their flesh is firm and juicy: they are commonly
called silver mackerel, from their beautiful appearance, their colour
being almost as bright when boiled as it was the moment they were
caught.</p>

Scotland. They soak them in water until they become pretty fresh; they
are then hung up in the sun and wind, on a stick through their eyes, to
dry; and then boiled or broiled. In this way they eat almost as well as
if they were new caught.&#8221; See the Hon. <span class="smcap">John Cochrane&#8217;s</span> <i>Seaman&#8217;s Guide</i>,
8vo. 1797, p. 34.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scotch haddocks should be soaked all night. You may boil or broil them;
if you broil, split them in two.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the different sorts of dried fish, except stock fish, are salted,
dried in the sun in prepared kilns, or by the smoke of wood fires, and
require to be softened and freshened, in proportion to their bulk,
nature, or dryness; the very dry sort, as cod, whiting, &amp;c. should be
steeped in lukewarm water, kept as near as possible to an equal degree
of heat. The larger fish should be steeped twelve hours, the smaller
about two; after which they should be taken out and hung up by the tails
until they are dressed. The reason for hanging them up is, that they
soften equally as in the steeping, without extracting too much of the
relish, which would render them insipid. When thus prepared, the small
fish, as whiting, tusks, &amp;c. should be floured and laid on the gridiron;
and when a little hardened on one side, must be turned and basted with
sweet oil upon a feather; and when basted on both sides, and well heated
through, taken up. A clear charcoal fire is the best for cooking them,
and the fish should be kept at a good distance, to broil gradually. When
they are done enough they will swell a little in the basting, and you
must not let them fall again. If boiled, as the larger fish generally
are, they should be kept just simmering over an equal fire, in which way
half an hour will do the largest fish, and five minutes the smallest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dried salmon, though a large fish, does not require more steeping than
a whiting; and when laid on the gridiron should be moderately peppered.
To herring and to all kinds of broiled salt fish, sweet oil is the best
basting.&#8221;</p>

sweetest, for two reasons; they are fresher and richer than any other
you can get: they catch them much more plentiful and larger in
Lancashire and Norfolk, but not so good: a great many are brought to
town from Norfolk, but barely come good, as they are a fish which should
always be eaten fresh; indeed, all river fish should be eaten fresh,

<p>Some piscivorous gourmands think that oysters are not best when quite
fresh from their beds, and that their flavour is too brackish and harsh,
and is much ameliorated by giving them a feed.</p>

<p>To <span class="smrom">FEED</span><a name="FNanchor_189-4_149" id="FNanchor_189-4_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_189-4_149" class="fnanchor">189-&sect;</a> oysters.&mdash;Cover them with clean water, with a pint of
salt to about two gallons (nothing else, no oatmeal, flour, nor any
other trumpery); this will cleanse them from the mud and sand, &amp;c. of
the bed; after they have lain in it twelve hours, change it for fresh
salt and water, and in twelve hours more they will be in prime order for
the mouth, and remain so two or three days: at the time of high water
you may see them open their shells, in expectation of receiving their
usual food. This process of feeding oysters is only employed when a
great many come up together.</p>

<p>The real Colchester, or Pyfleet barrelled oysters, that are packed at
the beds, are better without being put in water:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> they are carefully and
tightly packed, and must not be disturbed till wanted for table. These,
in moderate weather, will keep good for a week or ten days.</p>

<p>If an oyster opens his mouth in the barrel, he dies immediately.</p>

<p>To preserve the lives of barrelled oysters, put a heavy weight on the
wooden top of the barrel, which is to be placed on the surface of the
oysters. This is to be effected by removing the first hoop; the staves
will then spread and stand erect, making a wide opening for the head of
the barrel to fall down closely on the remaining fish, keeping them
close together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span>&mdash;The oysters which are commonly sold as barrelled oysters, are
merely the smallest natives, selected from the stock, and put into the
tub when ordered; and, instead of being of superior quality, are often
very inferior. To immature animals there is the same objection as to
unripe vegetables.</p>

<p><a name="obs-181" id="obs-181"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Common people are indifferent about the manner of opening
oysters, and the time of eating them after they are opened; nothing,
however, is more important in the enlightened eyes of the experienced
oyster-eater.</p>

<p>Those who wish to enjoy this delicious restorative in its utmost
perfection, must eat it the moment it is opened, with its own gravy in
the under shell; if not eaten while absolutely alive, its flavour and
spirit are lost.</p>

<p>The true lover of an oyster will have some regard for the feelings of
his little favourite, and will never abandon it to the mercy of a
bungling operator, but will open it himself, and contrive to detach the
fish from the shell so dexterously, that the oyster is hardly conscious
he has been ejected from his lodging, till he feels the teeth of the
piscivorous gourmand tickling him to death.</p>

<p><a name="nb-181" id="nb-181"></a>N.B. Fish is less nutritious than flesh: as a proof, when the trainer of
Newmarket wishes to waste a jockey, he is not allowed meat, nor even
pudding, if fish can be had. The white kinds of fish, turbots, soles,
whiting, cod, haddock, flounders, smelts, &amp;c. are less nutritious than
the oily, fat fish, such as eels, salmon, herrings, sprats, &amp;c.: the
latter, however, are more difficult to digest, and often disturb weak
stomachs, so that they are obliged to call in the assistance of Cayenne,
Cognac, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Shell-fish have long held a high rank in the catalogue of easily
digestible and speedily restorative foods; of these the oyster certainly
deserves the best character, but we think it has acquired not a little
more reputation for these qualities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> than it deserves; a well-dressed

first eaters of animal food; it corrupted their taste, and so excited
them to gluttony, that when they had eaten the same thing repeatedly,
their luxurious appetites called for variety. He who had devoured the
sheep, longed to masticate the shepherd!!!</p>

<p>&#8220;Nature seems to have provided other animals for the food of man, from
the astonishing increase of those which instinct points out to him as
peculiarly desirable for that purpose. For instance; so quick is the
produce of pigeons, that, in the space of four years, 14,760 may come
from a single pair; and in the like period, 1,274,840 from a couple of
rabbits, this is nothing to the millions of eggs in the milt of a

but the latter end of March, April, and May, they are generally
particularly fine; having shot their spawn, they come in fine order.

Orkney Isles, are generally very stringy, or what is commonly called
<i>woolly</i>, and sell at a very inferior price, but are caught in much
greater abundance than the Dogger cod. The cod are all caught with hook,
and brought alive in well-boats to the London markets. The cod cured on
the Dogger-bank is remarkably fine, and seldom cured above two or three
weeks before brought to market; the <i>barrel cod</i> is commonly cured on
the coast of Scotland and Yorkshire. There is a great deal of inferior
cured salt-fish brought from Newfoundland and Iceland.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <span class="smrom">SKULL</span> of a Dogger-bank cod is one of those concatenations of
<i>tit-bits</i> which some epicures are fond of, either baked or boiled: it
is composed of lots of pretty playthings or such finery, but will not do
for those who want a good meal: it may be bought for about 2<i>s.</i>: either
boil it whole, or cut it into pieces, flour and dry them, and then egg
and crumb, and fry them, or stew it (<a href="#no_158">No. 158</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;The <span class="smrom">TAIL</span> of a cod cut in fillets or slices, and fried, makes a good
dish, and is generally to be bought at a very reasonable rate; if
boiled, it is soft and watery. <i>The skull and tail</i> of a cod is a
favourite and excellent Scotch dish, stewed, and served up with anchovy
or oyster sauce, with the liquor it is boiled in, in a tureen.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ling</i> is brought to the London market in the same manner as cod, but
is very inferior to it, either fresh or salt.&#8221;</p>

New-York markets: of these, the common cod is the best, and is in season
from November till spring. The price varies from three to six cents the
pound, as the market is well or scantily supplied. The head and
shoulders of a large cod, boiled, is the best part to grace the
dinner-table. It is full of rich gelatinous matter, which is savoury and
easy of digestion. Cod&#8217;s sounds and tongues are found on the stalls of
the fishmongers in the winter season. They are rich and nourishing, and
may be prepared to garnish the dish, or served up separately boiled. A.</p>

to very considerable improvements in the art of cooking it. I have often
heard foreigners declare, that they never tasted salt fish dressed in

market is brought from the Severn, and begins to come into season the
beginning of November, but very few so early, perhaps not above one in
fifty, as many of them will not shoot their spawn till January, or
after, and then continue in season till October, when they begin to get
very thin and poor. The principal supply of salmon is from different
parts of Scotland, packed in ice, and brought by water: if the vessels
have a fair wind, they will be in London in three days; but it
frequently happens that they are at sea perhaps a fortnight, when the
greater part of the fish is perished, and has, for a year or two past,
sold as low as twopence per pound, and up to as much as eighteen pence
per pound at the same time, owing to its different degrees of goodness.
This accounts for the very low prices at which the itinerant fishmongers
cry their &#8220;<i>delicate</i> salmon,&#8221; &#8220;<i>dainty fresh</i> salmon,&#8221; and &#8220;<i>live</i>

about five or six pounds to ten pounds, are very good fish, and make
handsome dishes of fish, sent to table crooked in the form of an S.</p>

<p>&#8220;Berwick trout are a distinct fish from the gwilts, and are caught in
the river Tweed, and dressed in the same manner as the gwilt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Calvered salmon is the salmon caught in the Thames, and cut into slices
alive; and some few salmon are brought from Oxford to London alive, and
cut. A few slices make a handsome, genteel dish, but it is generally
very expensive; sometimes 15<i>s.</i> per pound.&#8221;</p>

mostly from Maine. It is also occasionally brought from the lakes and
rivers of the northern part of New-York in winter. A.]</p>

in the New-York market. That which arrives in the spring is most
esteemed, and in greatest plenty. Spring mackerel is a migrating fish,
and succeeds the shad, or commences its run along the coast of
New-Jersey and Long Island, just before the shad disappears. It does not
ascend the rivers, but continues its course north-eastward in immense
shoals, and is taken by the fishermen with the hook and line, while
sailing in smacks along the coast, from the mouth of the Delaware to
Nova Scotia. These fish are kept in cars, and sold alive in the markets.
They are mostly broiled, and brought to the breakfast-table. The larger
ones sometimes grace the dining-table. They may be boiled, but are best
when stuffed and baked in an oven. A.</p>

<p>A knuckle of veal of six pounds weight will make a large tureen of
excellent soup, and is thus easily prepared: cut half a pound of bacon
into slices about half an inch thick, lay it at the bottom of a
soup-kettle, or deep stew-pan, and on this place the knuckle of veal,
having first chopped the bone in two or three places; furnish it with

same of Jamaica pepper, and a good bundle of lemon-thyme, winter

over a quick fire till it boils; having skimmed it well, remove your
soup-kettle to the side of the fire; let it stew very gently till it is
quite tender, <i>i. e.</i> about four hours; then take out the bacon and
veal, strain the soup, and set it by in a cool place till you want it,
when you must take off the fat from the surface of your liquor, and
decant it (keeping back the settlings at the bottom) into a clean pan.</p>

<p>If you like a thickened soup, put three table-spoonfuls of the fat you
have taken off the soup into a small stew-pan, and mix it with four
table-spoonfuls of flour, pour a ladleful of soup to it, and mix it with
the rest by degrees, and boil it up till it is smooth.</p>

<p>Sir Kenelm Digby, in his &#8220;<i>Closet of Cookery</i>,&#8221; p. 149, London, 1669,
informs us, was made with &#8220;a brawny hen, or young cock, a handful of
parsley, one sprig of thyme, three of spearmint, a little balm, half a
great onion, a little pepper and salt, and a clove, with as much water
as will cover them; and this boiled to less than a pint for one good
porringerful.&#8221;</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Ox-heel Jelly.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_198" id="no_198"></a>No. 198.)</h3>

<p>Slit them in two, and take away the fat between the claws. The
proportion of water to each heel is about a quart: let it simmer gently
for eight hours (keeping it clean skimmed); it will make a pint and a
half of strong jelly, which is frequently used to make calves&#8217; feet
jelly (<a href="#no_481">No. 481</a>), or to add to mock turtle and other soups. See <a href="#no_240-1">No. 240*</a>.
This jelly evaporated, as directed in <a href="#no_252">No. 252</a>, will give about three
ounces and a half of strong glaze. An unboiled heel costs one shilling
and threepence: so this glaze, which is very inferior in flavour to <a href="#no_252">No.

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Clear Gravy Soups.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_200" id="no_200"></a>No. 200.)</h3>

<p>Cut half a pound of ham into slices, and lay them at the bottom of a
large stew-pan or stock-pot, with two or three pounds of lean beef, and
as much veal; break the bones, and lay them on the meat; take off the
outer skin of two large onions and two turnips; wash, clean, and cut
into pieces a couple of large carrots, and two heads of celery; and put
in three cloves and a large blade of mace. Cover the stew-pan close, and
set it over a smart fire. When the meat begins to stick to the bottom of
the stew-pan, turn it; and when there is a nice brown glaze at the
bottom of the stew-pan, cover the meat with hot water: watch it, and
when it is coming to boil put in half a pint of cold water; take off the
scum; then put in half a pint more cold water, and skim it again, and
continue to do so till no more scum rises. Now set it on one side of the
fire to boil gently for about four hours; strain it through a clean
tamis or napkin (do not squeeze it, or the soup will be thick) into a
clean stone pan; let it remain till it is cold, and then remove all the
fat. When you decant it, be careful not to disturb the settlings at the
bottom of the pan.</p>

<p>The broth should be of a fine amber colour, and as clear as rock water.
If it is not quite so bright as you wish it, put it into a stew-pan;
break two whites and shells of eggs into a basin; beat them well
together; put them into the soup: set it on a quick fire, and stir it
with a whisk till it boils; then set it on one side of the fire to
settle for ten minutes; run it through a fine napkin into a basin, and
it is ready.</p>

<p>However, if your broth is carefully skimmed, &amp;c. according to the
directions above given, it will be clear enough without clarifying;
which process impairs the flavour of it in a higher proportion than it
improves its appearance.</p>

<p>Thus you get four quarts of good soup at 8<i>d.</i> per quart, besides
another quart to make sauce for the meat, in the following manner:</p>

<p>Put a quart of the soup into a basin; put about an ounce of flour into a
stew-pan, and pour the broth to it by degrees, stirring it well
together; set it on the fire, and stir it till it boils; then (some put
in a glass of port wine, or mushroom catchup, <a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>) let it boil up,
and it is ready.</p>

<p>Put the meat in a rago&ucirc;t dish, and strain the sauce through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> a sieve
over the meat; you may put to it some capers, or minced gherkins or
walnuts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If the beef has been stewed with proper care in a very gentle manner,
and be taken up at &#8220;the critical moment when it is just tender,&#8221; you
will obtain an excellent and savoury meal for eight people for
fivepence; <i>i. e.</i> for only the cost of the glass of port wine.</p>

<p>The three following receipts are the contribution of a friend at
Edinburgh.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Winter Hotch-potch.</i></h3>

<p>Take the best end of a neck or loin of mutton; cut it into neat chops;
cut four carrots, and as many turnips into slices; put on four quarts of
water, with half the carrots and turnips, and a whole one of each, with
a pound of dried green pease, which must be put to soak the night
before; let it boil two hours, then take out the whole carrot and
tur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>nip; bruise and return them; put in the meat, and the rest of the
carrot and turnip, some pepper and salt, and boil slowly three-quarters
of an hour; a short time before serving, add an onion cut small and a
head of celery.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cocky-leeky Soup.</i></h3>

<p>Take a scrag of mutton, or shank of veal, three quarts of water (or
liquor in which meat has been boiled), and a good-sized fowl, with two
or three leeks cut in pieces about an inch long, pepper and salt; boil
slowly about an hour: then put in as many more leeks, and give it
three-quarters of an hour longer: this is very good, made of good
beef-stock, and leeks put in <a name="corr49" id="corr49"></a>it twice.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Lamb Stove, or Lamb Stew.</i></h3>

<p>Take a lamb&#8217;s head and lights; open the jaws of the head, and wash them
thoroughly; put them in a pot with some beef-stock, made with three
quarts of water, and two pounds of shin of beef, strained; boil very
slowly for an hour; wash and string two or three good handfuls of
spinach (or spinage); put it in twenty minutes before serving; add a
little parsley, and one or two onions, a short time before it comes off
the fire; season with pepper and salt, and serve all together in a
tureen.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Scotch Brose.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_205-1" id="no_205-1"></a>No. 205*.)</h3>

<p>&#8220;This favourite Scotch dish is generally made with the liquor meat has
been boiled in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put half a pint of oatmeal into a porringer with a little salt, if
there be not enough in the broth, of which add as much as will mix it to
the consistence of hasty-pudding, or a little thicker; lastly, take a
little of the fat that swims on the broth, and put it on the crowdie,
and eat it in the same way as hasty-pudding.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Carrot Soup.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_212" id="no_212"></a>No. 212.)</h3>

<p>Scrape and wash half a dozen large carrots; peel off the red outside
(which is the only part used for this soup); put it into a gallon
stew-pan, with one head of celery, and an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> onion, cut into thin pieces;
take two quarts of beef, veal, or mutton broth, or if you have any cold
roast-beef bones (or liquor, in which mutton or beef has been boiled),
you may make very good broth for this soup: when you have put the broth
to the roots, cover the stew-pan close, and set it on a slow stove for
two hours and a half, when the carrots will be soft enough (some cooks
put in a tea-cupful of bread-crumbs); boil for two or three minutes; rub
it through a tamis, or hair-sieve, with a wooden spoon, and add as much
broth as will make it a proper thickness, <i>i. e.</i> almost as thick as
pease soup: put it into a clean stew-pan; make it hot; season it with a
little salt, and send it up with some toasted bread, cut into pieces
half an inch square. Some put it into the soup; but the best way is to
send it up on a plate, as a side-dish.</p>

<p><a name="obs-212" id="obs-212"></a><i>Obs.</i> This is neither expensive nor troublesome to prepare. In the
kitchens of some opulent epicures, to make this soup make a little
stronger impression on the gustatory organs of &#8220;grands gourmands,&#8221; the
celery and onions are sliced, and fried in butter of a light brown, the
soup is poured into the stew-pan to them, and all is boiled up together.
But this must be done very carefully with butter, or very nicely
clarified fat; and the &#8220;grand cuisinier&#8221; adds spices, &amp;c. &#8220;<i>ad

three quarts of <a href="#no_200">No. 200</a> in a gallon soup-pot; set it by the side of the

pounded fine, which may be considered as the essence of celery (costs
only one-third of a farthing, and can be had at any season), put in a

<p>A peck of pease will make you a good tureen of soup. In shelling them,
put the old ones in one basin, and the young ones in another, and keep
out a pint of them, and boil them separately to put into your soup when
it is finished: put a large saucepan on the fire half full of water;
when it boils, put the pease in, with a handful of salt; let them boil
till they are done enough, <i>i. e.</i> from twenty to thirty minutes,
according to their age and size; then drain them in a colander, and put
them into a clean gallon stew-pan, and three quarts of plain veal or
mutton broth (drawn from meat without any spices or herbs, &amp;c. which
would overpower the flavour of the soup); cover the stew-pan close, and
set it over a slow fire to stew gently for an hour; add a tea-cupful of
bread-crumbs, and then rub it through a tamis into another stew-pan;
stir it with a wooden spoon, and if it is too thick, add a little more
broth: have ready boiled as for eating, a pint of young pease, and put
them into the soup; season with a little salt and sugar.</p>

<p><a name="nb-216" id="nb-216"></a>N.B. Some cooks, while this soup is going on, slice a couple of
cucumbers (as you would for eating); take out the seeds; lay them on a
cloth to drain, and then flour them, and fry them a light brown in a
little butter; put them into the soup the last thing before it goes to
table.</p>

<p><a name="obs-216" id="obs-216"></a><i>Obs.</i> If the soup is not green enough, pound a handful of pea-hulls or

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Plain green Pease Soup without Meat.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_217" id="no_217"></a>No. 217.)</h3>

<p>Take a quart of green pease (keep out half a pint of the youngest; boil
them separately, and put them in the soup when it is finished); put them
on in boiling water; boil them tender, and then pour off the water, and
set it by to make the soup with: put the pease into a mortar, and pound
them to a mash; then put them into two quarts of the water you boiled
the pease in; stir all well together; let it boil up for about five
minutes, and then rub it through a hair-sieve or tamis. If the pease are
good, it will be as thick and fine a vegetable soup as need be sent to

orders a gallon (and her ladyship&#8217;s directions have been copied by
almost every cookery-book maker who has strung receipts together since),

peeled, and a sprig of savoury, or sweet marjoram, or lemon-thyme; set
it on the trivet, and let it simmer very gently over a slow fire,
stirring it every quarter of an hour (to keep the pease from sticking
to, and burning at, the bottom of the soup-pot) till the pease are
tender, which will be in about three hours. Some cooks now slice a head
of celery, and half an ounce of onions, and fry them in a little butter,
and put them into the soup till they are lightly browned; then work the
whole through a coarse hair-sieve, and then through a fine sieve, or
(what is better) through a tamis, with the back of a wooden spoon: put
it into a clean stew-pan, with half a tea-spoonful of ground black
pepper;<a name="FNanchor_204-3_164" id="FNanchor_204-3_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_204-3_164" class="fnanchor">204-&#8225;</a> let it boil again for ten minutes, and if any fat

paper to drain the fat: be careful that this is done nicely: send these
up in one side-dish, and dried and powdered mint or savoury, or sweet

boil gently for two hours, then put in the pork, and boil very gently
till it is done enough to eat; this will take about an hour and a half,
or two hours longer, according to its thickness; when done, wash the

too thick, add some boiling water to it); when they are well softened,
work them through a coarse sieve, and then through a fine sieve or a

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cheap Soups.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_229" id="no_229"></a>No. 229.)</h3>

<p>Among the variety of schemes that have been suggested for &#8220;bettering the
condition of the poor,&#8221; a more useful or extensive charity cannot be
devised, than that of instructing them in economical cookery: it is one
of the most-important objects to which the attention of any real
well-wisher to the public interest can possibly be directed.</p>

<p>The best and cheapest method of making a nourishing soup, is least known
to those who have most need of it; it will enable those who have small
incomes and large families to make the most of the little they possess,
without pinching their children of that wholesome nourishment which is
necessary for the purpose of rearing them up to maturity in health and
strength.</p>

<p>The labouring classes seldom purchase what are called the coarser pieces
of meat, because they do not know how to dress them, but lay out their
money in pieces for roasting, &amp;c., of which the bones, &amp;c. enhance the
price of the actual meat to nearly a shilling per pound, and the
diminution of weight by roasting amounts to 32 per cent. This,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> for the
sake of saving time, trouble, and fire, is generally sent to an oven to
be baked; the nourishing parts are evaporated and dried up, its weight
is diminished nearly one-third, and all that a poor man can afford to
purchase with his week&#8217;s earnings, perhaps does not half satisfy the
appetites of himself and family for a couple of days.</p>

<p>If a hard-working man cannot get a comfortable meal at home, he soon
finds his way to the public-house, the poor wife contents herself with
tea and bread and butter, and the children are half starved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Kitchiner&#8217;s</span> receipt to make a cheap, nutritive, and palatable soup,
fully adequate to satisfy appetite and support strength, will open a new
source to those benevolent housekeepers who are disposed to relieve the
poor; will show the industrious classes how much they have it in their
power to assist themselves; and rescue them from being dependent on the
precarious bounty of others, by teaching them how they may obtain an
abundant, salubrious, and agreeable aliment for themselves and families,
for one penny per quart. See <a href="#Page_210">page 210</a>.</p>

<p>For various economical soups, see Nos. <a href="#no_204">204</a>, <a href="#no_239">239</a>, <a href="#no_240">240</a>, <a href="#no_224">224</a>, <a href="#no_221">221</a>, and

<p><a name="obs-229" id="obs-229"></a><i>Obs.</i> Dripping intended for soup should be taken out of the pan almost
as soon as it has dropped from the meat; if it is not quite clean,
clarify it. See receipt, <a href="#no_83">No. 83</a>.</p>

<p>Dripping thus prepared is a very different thing from that which has
remained in the dripping-pan all the time the meat has been roasting,
and perhaps live coals have dropped into it.<a name="FNanchor_209-1_167" id="FNanchor_209-1_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_209-1_167" class="fnanchor">209-*</a></p>

<p>Distributing soup does not answer half so well as teaching people how to
make it, and improve their comfort at home: the time lost in waiting at
the soup-house is seldom less than three hours; in which time, by any
industrious occupation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> however poorly paid, they could earn more money
than the quart of soup is worth.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Dr. Kitchiner&#8217;s</span> <i>Receipt to make a Gallon of Barley Broth for a Groat</i>.
See also <a href="#no_204">No. 204</a>.</h3>

<p>Put four ounces of Scotch barley (previously washed in cold water), and
four ounces of sliced onions, into five quarts of water; boil gently for
one hour, and pour it into a pan; then put into the saucepan from one to
two ounces of clean beef or mutton drippings, or melted suet, (to
clarify these, see <a href="#no_83">No. 83</a>) or two or three ounces of fat bacon minced;
when melted, stir into it four ounces of oatmeal; rub these together
till you make a paste (if this be properly managed, the whole of the fat
will combine with the barley broth, and not a particle appear on the
surface to offend the most delicate stomach); now add the barley broth,
at first a spoonful at a time, then the rest by degrees, stirring it
well together till it boils. To season it, put a drachm of
finely-pounded celery, or cress-seed, or half a drachm of each, and a
quarter of a drachm of finely-pounded Cayenne (<a href="#no_404">No. 404</a>), or a drachm and
a half of ground black pepper, or allspice, into a tea-cup, and mix it
up with a little of the soup, and then pour it into the rest; stir it
thoroughly together; let it simmer gently a quarter of an hour longer,
season it with salt, and it is ready.</p>

<p>The flavour may be varied by doubling the portion of onions, or adding a
clove of garlic or eschalot, and leaving out the celery-seed (<a href="#no_572">No. 572</a>),
or put in shredded roots as in <a href="#no_224">No. 224</a>; or, instead of oatmeal, thicken
it with ground rice, or pease, &amp;c., and make it savoury with fried
onions.</p>

<p>This preparation, excellent as it is, would, without variety, soon
become less agreeable.</p>

<p>Nothing so completely disarms poverty of its sting, as the means of
rendering a scanty pittance capable of yielding a comfortable variety.</p>

<p>Change of flavour is absolutely necessary, not merely as a matter of
pleasure and comfort, but of health; <i>toujours perdrix</i> is a true
proverb.</p>

<p>This soup will be much improved, if, instead of water, it be made with
the liquor meat has been boiled in; at tripe, cow-heel, and cook-shops,
this may be had for little or nothing.</p>

<p>This soup has the advantage of being very soon and easily made, with no
more fuel than is necessary to warm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> a room; those who have not tasted
it, cannot imagine what a savoury and satisfying meal is produced by the
combination of these cheap and homely ingredients.</p>

<p>If the generally-received opinion be true, that animal and vegetable
foods afford nourishment in proportion to the quantity of oil, jelly,
and mucilage, that can be extracted from them, this soup has strong
claims to the attention of rational economists.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Craw-fish Soup.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_235" id="no_235"></a>No. 235.)</h3>

<p>This soup is sometimes made with beef, or veal broth, or with fish, in
the following manner:</p>

<p>Take flounders, eels, gudgeons, &amp;c., and set them on to boil in cold
water; when it is pretty nigh boiling, skim it well; and to three quarts
put in a couple of onions, and as many carrots cut to pieces, some
parsley, a dozen berries of black and Jamaica pepper, and about half a
hundred craw-fish; take off the small claws and shells of the tails;
pound them fine, and boil them with the broth about an hour; strain off,
and break in some crusts of bread to thicken it, and, if you can get it,
the spawn of a lobster; pound it, and put it to the soup; let it simmer
very gently for a couple of minutes; put in your craw-fish to get hot,
and the soup is ready.</p>

<p><a name="obs-235" id="obs-235"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;One of my predecessors recommends craw-fish pounded alive, to
sweeten the sharpness of the blood. Vide <span class="smcap">Clermont&#8217;s</span> <i>Cookery</i>, p. 5,

and put them into it, to boil for twenty minutes, then strain it; and
then to thicken it, take the live spawn and bruise it in a mortar with a
little butter and flour; rub it through a sieve, and add it to the soup
with the meat of the lobsters, and the remaining coral; let it simmer

<p>The best parts for this purpose are the leg or shin, or a piece of the
middle of a brisket of beef, of about seven or eight pounds weight; lay
it on a fish-drainer, or when you take it up put a slice under it, which
will enable you to place it on the dish entire; put it into a soup-pot
or deep stew-pan, with cold water enough to cover it, and a quart over;
set it on a quick fire to get the scum up, which remove as it rises;
then put in two carrots, two turnips, two leeks, or two large onions,
two heads of celery, two or three cloves, and a fagot of parsley and
sweet herbs; set the pot by the side of the fire to simmer very gently,
till the meat is just tender enough to eat: this will require about four
or five hours.</p>

<p>Put a large carrot, a turnip, a large onion, and a head or two of
celery, into the soup whole; take them out as soon as they are done
enough; lay them on a dish till they are cold; then cut them into small

table-spoonful of mushroom catchup.</p>

<p>If a thickened soup is preferred, take four large table-spoonfuls of the
clear fat from the top of the pot, and four spoonfuls of flour; mix it
smooth together; then by degrees stir it well into the soup, which
simmer for ten minutes longer at least; skim it well, and pass it
through a tamis, or fine sieve, and add the vegetables and seasoning the
same as directed in the clear soup.</p>

<p>Should be prepared the day before it is to be eaten, as you cannot cut
the meat off the head into neat mouthfuls unless it is cold: therefore,
the day before you want this soup, put half an ox-cheek into a tub of
cold water to soak for a couple of hours; then break the bones that have
not been broken at the butcher&#8217;s, and wash it very well in warm water;
put it into a pot, and cover it with cold water; when it boils, skim it
very clean, and then put in one head of celery, a couple of carrots, a

allspice, and a bundle of sweet herbs, such as marjoram, lemon-thyme,
savoury, and a handful of parsley; cover the soup-pot close, and set it
on a slow fire; take off the scum, which will rise when it is coming to
a boil, and set it by the fireside to stew very gently for about three
hours; take out the head, lay it on a dish, pour the soup through a fine
sieve into a stone-ware pan, and set it and the head by in a cool place
till the next day: then cut the meat into neat mouthfuls, skim and
strain off the broth, put two quarts of it and the meat into a clean
stew-pan, let it simmer very gently for half an hour longer, and it is
ready. If you wish it thickened (which we do not recommend, for the
reasons given in the <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">7th chapter</a> of the Rudiments of Cookery), put two
ounces of butter into a stew-pan; when it is melted, throw in as much
flour as will dry it up; when they are all well mixed together, and
browned by degrees, pour to this your soup, and stir it well together;
let it simmer for half an hour longer; strain it through a hair-sieve
into a clean stew-pan, and put to it the meat of the head; let it stew
half an hour longer, and season it with Cayenne pepper, salt, and a
glass of good wine, or a table-spoonful of brandy. See Ox-cheek stewed,

broth into a clean stew-pan, with as much flour as will make it into a
paste; set this over the fire, and stir them well together; then pour in
the broth by degrees, stirring it, and mixing it with the thickening;
let it simmer for another half hour, and when you have well skimmed it,
and it is quite smooth, then strain it through a tamis into a clean

<p>Must be made the day before it is to be eaten. Procure an ox-heel
undressed, or only scalded (not one that has been already boiled, as
they are at the tripe-shops, till almost all the gelatinous parts are
extracted), and two that have been boiled as they usually are at the
tripe-shops.</p>

<p>Cut the meat off the boiled heels into neat mouthfuls, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> set it by on
a plate; put the trimmings and bones into a stew-pan, with three quarts
of water, and the unboiled heel cut into quarters; furnish a stew-pan
with two onions, and two turnips pared and sliced; pare off the red part
of a couple of large carrots, add a couple of eschalots cut in half, a
bunch of savoury or lemon-thyme, and double the quantity of parsley; set
this over, or by the side of a slow, steady fire, and keep it closely
covered and simmering very gently (or the soup liquor will evaporate)
for at least seven hours: during which, take care to remove the fat and
scum that will rise to the surface of the soup, which must be kept as
clean as possible.</p>

<p>Now strain the liquor through a sieve, and put two ounces of butter into
a clean stew-pan; when it is melted, stir into it as much flour as will
make it a stiff paste; add to it by degrees the soup liquor; give it a
boil up; strain it through a sieve, and put in the peel of a lemon pared
as thin as possible, and a couple of bay-leaves, and the meat of the
boiled heels; let it go on simmering for half an hour longer, <i>i. e.</i>
till the meat is tender. Put in the juice of a lemon, a glass of wine,
and a table-spoonful of mushroom catchup, and the soup is ready for the
tureen.</p>

<p><a name="obs-240-1" id="obs-240-1"></a><i>Obs.</i> Those who are disposed to make this a more substantial dish, may

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Hare, Rabbit, or Partridge Soup.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_241" id="no_241"></a>No. 241.)</h3>

<p>An old hare, or birds, when so tough as to defy the teeth in any other
form, will make very good soup.</p>

<p>Cut off the legs and shoulders; divide the body crossways, and stew them
very gently in three quarts of water, with one carrot, about one ounce
of onion, with four cloves, two blades of pounded mace, twenty-four
black peppers, and a bundle of sweet herbs, till the hare is tender
(most cooks add to the above a couple of slices of ham or bacon, and a
bay leaf, &amp;c., but my palate and purse both plead against such
extravagance; the hare makes sufficiently savoury soup without them):
the time this will take depends very much upon its age, and how long it
has been kept before it is dressed: as a general rule, about three
hours: in the mean time, make a dozen and a half of nice forcemeat balls
(as big as nutmegs) of <a href="#no_379">No. 379</a>; when the hare is quite tender, take the
meat off the back, and the upper joint of the legs; cut it into neat
mouthfuls, and lay it aside; cut the rest of the meat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> off the legs,
shoulders, &amp;c., mince it and pound it in a mortar, with an ounce of
butter, and two or three table-spoonfuls of flour moistened with a
little soup; rub this through a hair-sieve, and put it into the soup to
thicken it; let it simmer slowly half an hour longer, skimming it well;
put it through the tamis into the pan again; and put in the meat with a
glass of claret or port wine, and a table-spoonful of currant jelly to
each quart of soup; season it with salt, put in the forcemeat balls, and
when all is well warmed, the soup is ready.</p>

<p>In the game season, it is easy for a cook to give her master a very good
soup at a very little expense, by taking all the meat off the breasts of
any cold birds which have been left the preceding day, and pounding it
in a mortar, and beating to pieces the legs and bones, and boiling them
in some broth for an hour. Boil six turnips; mash them, and strain them
through a tamis-cloth with the meat that has been pounded in a mortar;
strain your broth, and put a little of it at a time into the tamis to
help you to strain all of it through. Put your soup-kettle near the
fire, but do not let it boil: when ready to dish your dinner, have six
yelks of eggs mixed with half a pint of cream; strain through a sieve;
put your soup on the fire, and as it is coming to boil, put in the eggs,
and stir well with a wooden spoon: do not let it boil, or it will
curdle.</p>

<p>Scald and pick very clean a couple sets of goose, or four of duck
giblets (the fresher the better); wash them well in warm water, in two
or three waters; cut off the noses and split the heads; divide the
gizzards and necks into mouthfuls. If the gizzards are not cut into
pieces before they are done enough, the rest of the meat, &amp;c. will be
done too much; and knives and forks have no business in a soup-plate.
Crack the bones of the legs, and put them into a stew-pan; cover them
with cold water: when they boil, take off the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> scum as it rises; then
put in a bundle of herbs, such as lemon-thyme, winter savoury, or
marjoram, about three sprigs of each, and double the quantity of
parsley, an onion, twenty berries of allspice, the same of black pepper;
tie them all up in a muslin bag, and set them to stew very gently till
the gizzards are tender: this will take from an hour and a half to two
hours, according to the size and age of the giblets: take them up with a
skimmer, or a spoon full of holes, put them into the tureen, and cover
down close to keep warm till the soup is ready.</p>

<p>To thicken the soup. Melt an ounce and a half of butter in a clean
stew-pan; stir in as much flour as will make it into a paste; then pour
to it by degrees a ladleful of the giblet liquor; add the remainder by
degrees; let it boil about half an hour, stirring it all the while for
fear it should burn; skim it, and strain it through a fine sieve into a
basin; wash out the stew-pan; then return the soup into it, and season
it with a glass of wine, a table-spoonful of mushroom catchup, and a
little salt; let it have one boil up; and then put the giblets in to get
hot, and the soup is ready.</p>

<p><a name="obs-244" id="obs-244"></a><i>Obs.</i> Thus managed, one set of goose, or two of duck giblets (which
latter may sometimes be had for 3<i>d.</i>), will make a quart of healthful,
nourishing soup: if you think the giblets alone will not make the gravy
savoury enough, add a pound of beef or mutton, or bone of a knuckle of
veal, and heighten its &#8220;<i>piquance</i>&#8221; by adding a few leaves of sweet
basil, the juice of half a Seville orange or lemon, and half a glass of
wine, and a little of <a href="#no_343-1">No. 343*</a> to each quart of soup.</p>

<p>Those who are fond of forcemeat may slip the skin off the neck, and fill
it with <a href="#no_378">No. 378</a>; tie up the other end tight; put it into the soup about
half an hour before you take it up, or make some nice savoury balls of
the duck stuffing, <a href="#no_61">No. 61</a>.</p>

<p><a name="obs-244-1" id="obs-244-1"></a><i>Obs.</i> Bespeak the giblets a couple of days before you desire to have
them: this is a favourite soup when the giblets are done till nicely

the fresher they are the better.</p>

wish to have the full benefit of the meat, only stew it till it is just
tender, cut it into mouthfuls, and put it into the soup. To thicken it,

<p>Get a calf&#8217;s head with the skin on (the fresher the better); take out
the brains, wash the head several times in cold water, let it soak for
about an hour in spring-water, then lay it in a stew-pan, and cover it
with cold water, and half a gallon over; as it becomes warm, a great
deal of scum will rise, which must be immediately removed; let it boil
gently for one hour, take it up, and when almost cold, cut the head into
pieces about an inch and a half by an inch and a quarter, and the tongue
into mouthfuls, or rather make a side-dish of the tongue and brains, as
in <a href="#no_10">No. 10</a>.</p>

<p>When the head is taken out, put in the stock meat,<a name="FNanchor_219-3_174" id="FNanchor_219-3_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_219-3_174" class="fnanchor">219-&#8225;</a> about five

trimmings and bones of the head, skim it well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> and then cover it close,
and let it boil five hours (reserve a couple of quarts of this to make
gravy sauces, &amp;c. see <a href="#no_307">No. 307</a>); then strain it off, and let it stand
till the next morning; then take off the fat, set a large stew-pan on
the fire with half a pound of good fresh butter, twelve ounces of onions
sliced, and four ounces of green sage; chop it a little; let these fry
one hour; then rub in half a pound of flour, and by degrees add your
broth till it is the thickness of cream; season it with a quarter of an
ounce of ground allspice and half an ounce of black pepper ground very
fine, salt to your taste, and the rind of one lemon peeled very thin;
let it simmer very gently for one hour and a half, then strain it
through a hair-sieve; do not rub your soup to get it through the sieve,
or it will make it grouty; if it does not run through easily, knock your
wooden-spoon against the side of your sieve; put it in a clean stew-pan
with the head, and season it by adding to each gallon of soup half a
pint of wine; this should be Madeira, or, if you wish to darken the
colour of your soup, claret, and two table-spoonfuls of lemon-juice, see
<a href="#no_407-1">No. 407*</a>; let it simmer gently till the meat is tender; this may take
from half an hour to an hour: take care it is not over-done; stir it
frequently to prevent the meat sticking to the bottom of the stew-pan,
and when the meat is quite tender the soup is ready.</p>

zest, and a little minced onion, put in half a tea-cupful of stock,
cover it with puff paste, and bake it one hour: when the soup comes from

see <a href="#no_485">No. 485</a>.</p>

<p>To season it, to each gallon of soup put two table-spoonfuls of
lemon-juice, see <a href="#no_407-1">No. 407*</a>, same of mushroom catchup (<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), and one
of essence of anchovy (<a href="#no_433">No. 433</a>), half a pint of wine (this should be
Madeira, or, if you wish to darken the colour of your soup, claret), a
tea-spoonful of curry powder (<a href="#no_455">No. 455</a>), or a quarter of a drachm of
Cayenne, and the peel of a lemon pared as thin as possible; let it
simmer five minutes more, take out the lemon-peel, and the soup is ready
for the tureen.</p>

<p>While the soup is doing, prepare for each tureen a dozen and a half of
mock turtle forcemeat balls (to make these, see <a href="#no_375">No. 375</a> or <a href="#no_recipe">No. 376</a>, <a href="#no_390">No.

egg balls; and put them into the tureen. Brain balls, or cakes, are a
very elegant addition, and are made by boiling the brains for ten
minutes, then putting them in cold water, and cutting them into pieces
about as big as a large nutmeg; take savoury, or lemon-thyme dried and
finely-powdered, nutmeg grated, and pepper and salt, and pound them all
together; beat up an egg, dip the brains in it, and then roll them in
this mixture, and make as much of it as possible stick to them; dip them
in the egg again, and then in finely-grated and sifted bread-crumbs; fry
them in hot fat, and send them up as a side-dish.</p>

<p>A veal sweetbread, prepared as in <a href="#no_89">No. 89</a>, not too much done or it will
break, cut into pieces the same size as you cut the calf&#8217;s head, and put
in the soup, just to get warm before it goes to table, is a superb
&#8220;<i>bonne bouche</i>;&#8221; and pickled tongue, stewed till very tender, and cut
into mouthfuls, is a favourite addition. We order the meat to be cut
into mouthfuls, that it may be eaten with a spoon: the knife and fork
have no business in a soup-plate.</p>

bedevilled with a copious addition of anchovies, mushrooms, truffles,
morelles, curry-powder, artichoke bottoms, salmon&#8217;s head and liver, or
the soft part of oysters or lobsters, soles cut in mouthfuls, a bottle
of Madeira, a pint of brandy, &amp;c.; and to complete their surfeiting and

<p>Desire the butcher to break the bones of a leg or a shin of beef, of ten
pounds weight (the fresher killed the better); put it into a soup-pot (a
digester<a name="FNanchor_223-3_179" id="FNanchor_223-3_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_223-3_179" class="fnanchor">223-&#8225;</a> is the best utensil for this purpose) that will well
hold it; just cover it with cold water, and set it on the fire to heat
gradually till it nearly boils (this should be at least an hour); skim
it attentively while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> any scum rises; pour in a little cold water, to
throw up the scum that may remain; let it come to a boil again, and
again skim it carefully: when no more scum rises, and the broth appears
clear (put in neither roots, nor herbs, nor salt), let it boil for eight
or ten hours, and then strain it through a hair-sieve into a brown stone
pan; set the broth where it will cool quickly; put the meat into a
sieve, let it drain, make potted beef (<a href="#no_503">No. 503</a>), or it will be very
acceptable to many poor families. Next day remove every particle of fat
from the top of it, and pour it through a tamis, or fine sieve, as
quietly as possible, into a stew-pan, taking care not to let any of the
settlings at the bottom of the stone pan go into the stew-pan, which
should be of thick copper, perfectly well tinned; add a quarter of an
ounce of whole black pepper to it; let it boil briskly, with the
stew-pan uncovered, on a quick fire; if any scum rises, take it off with
a skimmer: when it begins to thicken, and is reduced to about a quart,
put it into a smaller stew-pan; set it over a gentler fire, till it is
reduced to the thickness of a very thick syrup; take care that it does
not burn, a moment&#8217;s inattention now will lose you all your labour, and
the soup will be spoiled: take a little of it out in a spoon and let it
cool; if it sets into a strong jelly, it is done enough; if it does not,
boil it a little longer till it does; have ready some little pots, such
as are used for potted meats, about an inch and a half deep, taking care
that they are quite dry; we recommend it to be kept in these pots, if it
is for home consumption (the less it is reduced, the better is the
flavour of the soup), if it be sufficiently concentrated to keep for six
months; if you wish to preserve it longer, put it into such bladders as
are used for German sausages, or if you prefer it in the form of cakes,
pour it into a dish about a quarter of an inch deep; when it is cold,
turn it out and weigh the cake, and divide it with a paste-cutter into
pieces of half an ounce and an ounce each; place them in a warm room,
and turn them frequently till they are thoroughly dried; this will take
a week or ten days; turn them twice a day; when well hardened, and kept
in a dry place, they may be preserved for several years in any climate.</p>

<p>This extract of meat makes excellent &#8220;<i>tablettes de Bouillon</i>,&#8221; for
those who are obliged to endure long fasting.</p>

<p>If the surface becomes mouldy, wipe it with a little warm water; the
mouldy taste does not penetrate the mass.</p>

<p>If, after several days&#8217; drying, it does not become so hard as you wish,
put it into a bainmarie stew-pan, or milk-boiler, till it is evaporated
to the consistence you wish; or, set the pots in a cool oven, or in a
cheese-toaster, at a considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> distance from the fire: this is the
only safe way of reducing it very much, without the risk of its burning,
and acquiring an extremely disagreeable, acrid flavour, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="obs-252" id="obs-252"></a><i>Obs.</i> The uses of this concentrated essence of meat are numerous. It is
equally economical and convenient for making extempore broths enumerated
in the <a href="#obs-200"><i>Obs.</i></a> to <a href="#no_200">No. 200</a>, sauces and gravies for hashed or stewed meat,
game, or poultry, &amp;c.</p>

<p>You may thicken it and flavour it as directed in <a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>; to make gravy,
sauces, &amp;c. take double the quantity ordered for broth.</p>

<p>If you have time and opportunity, as there is no seasoning in the soup,
either of roots, herbs, or spice, boil an onion with or without a bit of
parsley and sweet herbs, and a few corns of allspice, or other spice, in
the water you melt the soup in, which may be flavoured with mushroom
catchup (<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), or eschalot wine (<a href="#no_402">No. 402</a>), essence of sweet herbs
(<a href="#no_417">No. 417</a>), savoury spice (<a href="#no_421">No. 421</a>, or <a href="#no_457">No. 457</a>), essence of celery (<a href="#no_409">No.
409</a>), &amp;c. or zest (<a href="#no_recipe">No. 255</a>); these may be combined in the proportions
most agreeable to the palate of the eater, and are as portable as
portable soup, for a very small portion will flavour a pint.</p>

<p>The editor adds nothing to the solution of this soup, but a very little
ground black pepper and some salt.</p>

<p><a name="nb-252" id="nb-252"></a>N.B. If you are a careful manager, you need not always purchase meat on
purpose to make this; when you dress a large dinner, you can make glaze
at very small cost, by taking care of the trimmings and parings of the
meat, game, and poultry, you use: wash them well, put them into a
stew-pan, cover them with the liquor you have boiled meat in, and
proceed as in the above receipt; and see <a href="#obs-185"><i>Obs.</i></a> on <a href="#no_185">No. 185</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span> This portable soup is a most convenient article in cookery;
especially in small families, where it will save a great deal of time
and trouble. It is also economical, for no more will be melted than is
wanted; so there is no waste.</p>

<p>Nine pounds of neck of beef, costing 2<i>s.</i> 7<span class="hide">&nbsp;</span><span class="num">1</span>/<span class="den">2</span><i>d.</i> produced nine
ounces of very nice soup; the bones, when boiled, weighed ten ounces.</p>

<p>Half an ox-cheek, costing 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> and weighing 14<span class="hide">&nbsp;</span><span class="num">3</span>/<span class="den">4</span> pounds,
produced thirteen ounces; but not so firm or clear, and far inferior in
flavour to that obtained from a shin of beef.</p>

<p>A sheep&#8217;s head, costing 9<i>d.</i>, produced three ounces and a half.</p>

<p>Two pounds of lean meat, from the blade-bone of beef, produced hardly an
ounce.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>The addition of an ounce of gum arabic, and two ounces of isinglass, to
four ounces of the extract from a leg of beef, considerably diminished
the consistence of the mass, without adding to its bulk.</p>

<p>It has been thought that the portable soup which is manufactured for
sale, is partly made with ox-heels; but the experiment (<a href="#no_198">No. 198</a>) proves
this cannot be, as an ounce of the jelly from ox-heel costs 5<i>d.</i> For
the cheapest method of procuring a hard jelly, see <a href="#nb-481">N.B.</a> to <a href="#no_481">No. 481</a>;
nineteen bones, costing 4<span class="hide">&nbsp;</span><span class="num">1</span>/<span class="den">2</span><i>d.</i> produced three ounces: almost as cheap
as Salisbury glue.</p>

<p>A knuckle of veal, weighing 4<span class="hide">&nbsp;</span><span class="num">3</span>/<span class="den">4</span> pounds, and costing 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
produced five ounces.</p>

<p>A shin of beef, weighing nine pounds, and costing 1<i>s.</i> 10<span class="hide">&nbsp;</span><span class="num">1</span>/<span class="den">2</span><i>d.</i>
produced nine ounces of concentrated soup, sufficiently reduced to keep
for several months. After the boiling, the bones in this joint weighed
two pounds and a quarter, and the meat two pounds and a quarter.</p>

<p>The result of these experiments is, that the product from legs and shins
of beef was almost as large in quantity, and of much superior quality
and flavour, as that obtained from any of the other materials; the
flavour of the product from mutton, veal, &amp;c. is comparatively insipid.</p>

<p>As it is difficult to obtain this ready-made of good quality, and we
could not find any proper and circumstantial directions for making it,
which, on trial, answered the purpose, and it is really a great
acquisition to the army and navy, to travellers, invalids, &amp;c. the
editor has bestowed some time, &amp;c. in endeavouring to learn, and to
teach, how it may be prepared in the easiest, most economical, and
perfect manner.</p>

<p>The ordinary selling price is from 10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i>, but you may make it
according to the above receipt for 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per pound, <i>i. e.</i> for
2<span class="hide">&nbsp;</span><span class="num">1</span>/<span class="den">2</span><i>d.</i> per ounce, which will make you a pint of broth.</p>

<p>Those who do not regard the expense, and like the flavour, may add the
lean of ham, in the proportion of a pound to eight pounds of leg of
beef.</p>

<p>It may also be flavoured, by adding to it, at the time you put the broth
into the smaller stew-pan, mushroom catchup, eschalot wine, essences of
spice or herbs, &amp;c.; we prefer it quite plain; it is then ready to be
converted, in an instant, into a basin of beef tea, for an invalid, and
any flavour may be immediately communicated to it by the magazine of
taste (<a href="#no_462">No. 462</a>).</p>

the turtle into a broad earthen vessel, to keep cool: when wanted for
table, to two quarts of soup add one gill of boiling water or veal
broth, put it over a good, clear fire, keeping it gently stirred (that
it may not burn); when it has boiled about three minutes, skim it, and
put it in the tureen.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Melted Butter,</i></h3>

<p>Is so simple and easy to prepare, that it is a matter of general
surprise, that what is done so often in every English kitchen, is so
seldom done right: foreigners may well say, that although we have only
one sauce for vegetables, fish, flesh, fowl, &amp;c. we hardly ever make
that good.</p>

<p>It is spoiled nine times out of ten, more from idleness than from
ignorance, and rather because the cook won&#8217;t than because she can&#8217;t do
it; which can only be the case when housekeepers will not allow butter
to do it with.</p>

<p>Good melted butter cannot be made with mere flour and water; there must
be a full and proper proportion of butter. As it must be always on the
table, and is the foundation of almost all our English sauces, we have,</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>Melted butter and oysters,</li>
  <li>&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; parsley,</li>
  <li>&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; anchovies,</li>
  <li>&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; eggs,</li>
  <li>&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; shrimps,</li>
  <li>&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; lobsters,</li>
  <li>&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; capers, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">I have tried every way of making it; and I trust, at last, that I have
written a receipt, which, if the cook will carefully observe, she will
constantly succeed in giving satisfaction.</p>

<p>In the quantities of the various sauces I have ordered, I have had in
view the providing for a family of half-a-dozen moderate people.</p>

<p>Never pour sauce over meat, or even put it into the dish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span> however well
made, some of the company may have an antipathy to it; tastes are as
different as faces: moreover, if it is sent up separate in a boat, it
will keep hot longer, and what is left may be put by for another time,
or used for another purpose.</p>

<p><i>Lastly.</i> Observe, that in ordering the proportions of meat, butter,
wine, spice, &amp;c. in the following receipts, the proper quantity is set
down, and that a less quantity will not do; and in some instances those
palates which have been used to the extreme of <i>piquance</i>, will require
additional excitement.<a name="FNanchor_228-1_180" id="FNanchor_228-1_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_228-1_180" class="fnanchor">228-*</a> If we have erred, it has been on the right
side, from an anxious wish to combine economy with elegance, and the
wholesome with the toothsome.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Melted Butter.</i><a name="no_256" id="no_256"></a></h3>

<p>Keep a pint stew-pan<a name="FNanchor_228-2_181" id="FNanchor_228-2_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_228-2_181" class="fnanchor">228-&#8224;</a> for this purpose only.</p>

<p>Cut two ounces of butter into little bits, that it may melt more easily,
and mix more readily; put it into the stew-pan with a large tea-spoonful
(<i>i. e.</i> about three drachms) of flour, (some prefer arrow-root, or
potato starch, <a href="#no_448">No. 448</a>), and two table-spoonfuls of milk.</p>

<p>When thoroughly mixed, add six table-spoonfuls of water; hold it over
the fire, and shake it round every minute (all the while the same way),
till it just begins to simmer; then let it stand quietly and boil up. It
should be of the thickness of good cream.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-228" id="nb-p-228"></a>N.B. Two table-spoonfuls of <a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>, instead of the milk, will make as
good mushroom sauce as need be, and is a superlative accompaniment to
either fish, flesh, or fowl.</p>

<p><a name="obs-p-228" id="obs-p-228"></a><i>Obs.</i> This is the best way of preparing melted butter; milk mixes with
the butter much more easily and more intimately than water alone can be
made to do. This is of proper thickness to be mixed at table with
flavouring essences,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span> anchovy, mushroom, or cavice, &amp;c. If made merely
to pour over vegetables, add a little more milk to it.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-228-2" id="nb-p-228-2"></a>N.B. If the butter oils, put a spoonful of cold water to it, and stir it
with a spoon; if it is very much oiled, it must be poured backwards and
forwards from the stew-pan to the sauce-boat till it is right again.</p>

<p><a name="mem_256" id="mem_256"></a><span class="smcap">Mem.</span> Melted butter made to be mixed with flavouring essences, catchups,
&amp;c. should be of the thickness of light batter, that it may adhere to
the fish, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Thickening.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_257" id="no_257"></a>No. 257.)</h3>

<p>Clarified butter is best for this purpose; but if you have none ready,
put some fresh butter into a stew-pan over a slow, clear fire; when it
is melted, add fine flour sufficient to make it the thickness of paste;
stir it well together with a wooden spoon for fifteen or twenty minutes,
till it is quite smooth, and the colour of a guinea: this must be done
very gradually and patiently; if you put it over too fierce a fire to
hurry it, it will become bitter and empyreumatic: pour it into an
earthen pan, and keep it for use. It will keep good a fortnight in
summer, and longer in winter.</p>

<p>A large spoonful will generally be enough to thicken a quart of gravy.</p>

<p><a name="obs-257" id="obs-257"></a><i>Obs.</i> This, in the French kitchen, is called <i>roux</i>. Be particularly
attentive in making it; if it gets any burnt smell or taste, it will
spoil every thing it is put into, see <a href="#obs-322"><i>Obs.</i></a> to <a href="#no_322">No. 322</a>. When cold, it
should be thick enough to cut out with a knife, like a solid paste.</p>

<p>It is a very essential article in the kitchen, and is the basis of
consistency in most made-dishes, soups, sauces, and rago&ucirc;ts; if the
gravies, &amp;c. are too thin, add this thickening, more or less, according
to the consistence you would wish them to have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span> In making thickening, the less butter, and the more flour you use,
the better; they must be thoroughly worked together, and the broth, or
soup, &amp;c. you put them to, added by degrees: take especial care to
incorporate them well together, or your sauces, &amp;c. will taste floury,
and have a disgusting, greasy appearance: therefore, after you have
thickened your sauce, add to it some broth, or warm water, in the
proportion of two table-spoonfuls to a pint, and set it by the side of
the fire, to raise any fat, &amp;c. that is not thoroughly incorporated with
the gravy, which you must carefully remove as it comes to the top. This
is called cleansing, or finishing the sauce.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span><sup class="astsup">*</sup><sub class="astsub">*</sub><sup class="astsup">*</sup> Half an ounce of butter, and a table-spoonful of flour, are about
the proportion for a pint of sauce to make it as thick as cream.</p>

<p><a name="nb-257" id="nb-257"></a>N.B. The fat skimmings off the top of the broth pot are sometimes
substituted for butter (see <a href="#no_240">No. 240</a>); some cooks merely thicken their
soups and sauces with flour, as we have directed in <a href="#no_245">No. 245</a>, or potato
farina, <a href="#no_448">No. 448</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Clarified Butter.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_259" id="no_259"></a>No. 259.)</h3>

<p>Put the butter in a nice, clean stew-pan, over a very clear, slow fire;
watch it, and when it is melted, carefully skim off the buttermilk, &amp;c.
which will swim on the top; let it stand a minute or two for the
impurities to sink to the bottom; then pour the clear butter through a
sieve into a clean basin, leaving the sediment at the bottom of the
stew-pan.</p>

<p><a name="obs-259" id="obs-259"></a><i>Obs.</i> Butter thus purified will be as sweet as marrow, a very useful
covering for potted meats, &amp;c., and for frying fish equal to the finest
Florence oil; for which purpose it is commonly used by Catholics, and
those whose religious tenets will not allow them to eat viands fried in
animal oil.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Burnt Butter.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_260" id="no_260"></a>No. 260.)</h3>

<p>Put two ounces of fresh butter into a small frying-pan; when it becomes
a dark brown colour, add to it a table-spoonful and a half of good
vinegar, and a little pepper and salt.</p>

<p><a name="obs-260" id="obs-260"></a><i>Obs.</i> This is used as sauce for boiled fish, or poached eggs.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Oiled Butter.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_260-1" id="no_260-1"></a>No. 260*.)</h3>

<p>Put two ounces of fresh butter into a saucepan; set it at a distance
from the fire, so that it may melt gradually, till it comes to an oil;
and pour it off quietly from the dregs.</p>

<p><a name="obs-260-1" id="obs-260-1"></a><i>Obs.</i> This will supply the place of olive oil; and by some is preferred
to it either for salads or frying.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Parsley and Butter.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_261" id="no_261"></a>No. 261.)</h3>

<p>Wash some parsley very clean, and pick it carefully leaf by leaf; put a
tea-spoonful of salt into half a pint of boiling water: boil the parsley
about ten minutes; drain it on a sieve; mince it quite fine, and then
bruise it to a pulp.</p>

<p>The delicacy and excellence of this elegant and innocent relish depends
upon the parsley being minced very fine: put it into a sauce-boat, and
mix with it, by degrees, about half a pint of good melted butter (<a href="#no_256">No.
256</a>); only do not put so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> much flour to it, as the parsley will add to
its thickness: never pour parsley and butter over boiled things, but
send it up in a boat.</p>

<p><a name="obs-261" id="obs-261"></a><i>Obs.</i> In French cookery-books this is called &#8220;melted butter, English
fashion;&#8221; and, with the addition of a slice of lemon cut into dice, a
little allspice and vinegar, &#8220;Dutch sauce.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="nb-261" id="nb-261"></a>N.B. To preserve parsley through the winter: in May, June, or July, take
fine fresh-gathered sprigs; pick, and wash them clean; set on a stew-pan
half full of water; put a little salt in it; boil, and skim it clean,
and then put in the parsley, and let it boil for a couple of minutes;
take it out, and lay it on a sieve before the fire, that it may be dried
as quick as possible; put it by in a tin box, and keep it in a dry
place: when you want it, lay it in a basin, and cover it with warm water
a few minutes before you use it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Gooseberry Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_263" id="no_263"></a>No. 263.)</h3>

<p>Top and tail them close with a pair of scissors, and scald half a pint
of green gooseberries; drain them on a hair-sieve, and put them into
half a pint of melted butter, <a href="#no_256">No. 256</a>.</p>

<p>Some add grated ginger and lemon-peel, and the French, minced fennel;
others send up the gooseberries whole or mashed, without any butter, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Chervil, Basil, Tarragon, Burnet, Cress, and Butter.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_264" id="no_264"></a>No. 264.)</h3>

<p>This is the first time that chervil, which has so long been a favourite
with the sagacious French cook, has been introduced into an English
book. Its flavour is a strong concentration of the combined taste of
parsley and fennel, but more aromatic and agreeable than either; and is
an excellent sauce with boiled poultry or fish. Prepare it, &amp;c. as we
have directed for parsley and butter, <a href="#no_261">No. 261</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Fennel and Butter for Mackerel, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_265" id="no_265"></a>No. 265.)</h3>

<p>Is prepared in the same manner as we have just described in <a href="#no_261">No. 261</a>.</p>

<p><a name="obs-265" id="obs-265"></a><i>Obs.</i> For mackerel sauce, or boiled soles, &amp;c., some people take equal
parts of fennel and parsley; others add a sprig of mint, or a couple of
young onions minced very fine.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Mackerel-roe Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_266" id="no_266"></a>No. 266.)</h3>

<p>Boil the roes of mackerel (soft roes are best); bruise them with a spoon
with the yelk of an egg, beat up with a very little pepper and salt, and
some fennel and parsley boiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span> and chopped very fine, mixed with almost
half a pint of thin melted butter. See <a href="#no_256">No. 256</a>.</p>

<p>Mushroom catchup, walnut pickle, or soy may be added.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Egg Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_267" id="no_267"></a>No. 267.)</h3>

<p>This agreeable accompaniment to roasted poultry, or salted fish, is made
by putting three eggs into boiling water, and boiling them for about
twelve minutes, when they will be hard; put them into cold water till
you want them. This will make the yelks firmer, and prevent their
surface turning black, and you can cut them much neater: use only two of
the whites; cut the whites into small dice, the yelks into bits about a
quarter of an inch square; put them into a sauce-boat; pour to them half
a pint of melted butter, and stir them together.</p>

<p><a name="obs-267" id="obs-267"></a><i>Obs.</i> The melted butter for egg sauce need not be made quite so thick
as <a href="#no_256">No. 256</a>. If you are for superlative egg sauce, pound the yelks of a
couple of eggs, and rub them with the melted butter to thicken it.</p>

<p><a name="nb-267" id="nb-267"></a>N.B. Some cooks garnish salt fish with hard-boiled eggs cut in half.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Plum-pudding Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_269" id="no_269"></a>No. 269.)</h3>

<p>A glass of sherry, half a glass of brandy (or &#8220;cherry-bounce&#8221;), or
Cura&ccedil;oa (<a href="#no_474">No. 474</a>), or essence of punch (Nos. <a href="#no_471">471</a> and <a href="#no_479">479</a>), and two
tea-spoonfuls of pounded lump sugar (a very little grated lemon-peel is
sometimes added), in a quarter of a pint of thick melted butter: grate
nutmeg on the top.</p>

<p>See Pudding Catchup, <a href="#no_446">No. 446</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Anchovy Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_270" id="no_270"></a>No. 270.)</h3>

<p>Pound three anchovies in a mortar with a little bit of butter; rub it
through a double hair-sieve with the back of a wooden spoon, and stir it
into almost half a pint of melted butter (<a href="#no_256">No. 256</a>); or stir in a
table-spoonful of essence of anchovy, <a href="#no_433">No. 433</a>. To the above, many cooks
add lemon-juice and Cayenne.</p>

<p><a name="obs-270" id="obs-270"></a><i>Obs.</i> Foreigners make this sauce with good brown sauce (<a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>), or
white sauce (<a href="#no_364">No. 364</a>); instead of melted butter, add to it catchup, soy,
and some of their flavoured vinegars, (as elder or tarragon), pepper and
fine spice, sweet herbs, capers, eschalots, &amp;c. They serve it with most
roasted meats.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>N.B. Keep your anchovies well covered; first tie down your jar with
bladder moistened with vinegar, and then wiped dry; tie leather over
that: when you open a jar, moisten the bladder, and it will come off
easily; as soon as you have taken out the fish, replace the coverings;
the air soon rusts and spoils anchovies. See <a href="#no_433">No. 433</a>, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Garlic Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_272" id="no_272"></a>No. 272.)</h3>

<p>Pound two cloves of garlic with a piece of fresh butter, about as big as
a nutmeg; rub it through a double hair-sieve, and stir it into half a
pint of melted butter, or beef gravy or make it with garlic vinegar,
Nos. <a href="#no_400">400</a>, <a href="#no_401">401</a>, and <a href="#no_402">402</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Lemon Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_273" id="no_273"></a>No. 273.)</h3>

<p>Pare a lemon, and cut it into slices twice as thick as a half-crown
piece; divide these into dice, and put them into a quarter of a pint of
melted butter, <a href="#no_256">No. 256</a>.</p>

<p><a name="obs-273" id="obs-273"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Some cooks mince a bit of the lemon-peel (pared very thin) very
fine, and add it to the above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Caper Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_274" id="no_274"></a>No. 274. See also <a href="#no_295">No. 295</a>.)</h3>

<p>To make a quarter of a pint, take a table-spoonful of capers, and two
tea-spoonfuls of vinegar.</p>

<p>The present fashion of cutting capers is to mince one-third of them very
fine, and divide the others in half; put them into a quarter of a pint
of melted butter, or good thickened gravy (<a href="#no_329">No. 329</a>); stir them the same
way as you did the melted butter, or it will oil.</p>

<p><a name="obs-274" id="obs-274"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Some boil, and mince fine a few leaves of parsley, or chervil,
or tarragon, and add these to the sauce; others the juice of half a
Seville orange, or lemon.</p>

<p><i>Mem.</i>&mdash;Keep the caper bottle very closely corked, and do not use any of
the caper liquor: if the capers are not well covered with it, they will
immediately spoil; and it is an excellent ingredient in hashes, &amp;c. The
Dutch use it as a fish sauce, mixing it with melted butter.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Oyster Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_278" id="no_278"></a>No. 278.)</h3>

<p>Choose plump and juicy natives for this purpose: don&#8217;t take them out of
their shell till you put them into the stew-pan, see <a href="#obs-181"><i>Obs.</i></a> to <a href="#no_181">No. 181</a>.</p>

<p>To make good oyster sauce for half a dozen hearty fish-eaters, you
cannot have less than three or four dozen oysters. Save their liquor;
strain it, and put it and them into a stew-pan: as soon as they boil,
and the fish plump, take them off the fire, and pour the contents of the
stew-pan into a sieve over a clean basin; wash the stew-pan out with hot
water, and put into it the strained liquor, with about an equal quantity
of milk, and about two ounces and a half of butter, with which you have
well rubbed a large table-spoonful of flour; give it a boil up, and pour
it through a sieve into a basin (that the sauce may be quite smooth),
and then back again into the saucepan; now shave the oysters, and (if
you have the honour of making sauce for &#8220;a committee of taste,&#8221; take
away the gristly part also) put in only the soft part of them: if they
are very large, cut them in half, and set them by the fire to keep hot:
&#8220;if they boil after, they will become hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you have not liquor enough, add a little melted butter, or cream (see
<a href="#no_388">No. 388</a>), or milk beat up with the yelk of an egg (this must not be put
in till the sauce is done). Some barbarous cooks add pepper, or mace,
the juice or peel of a lemon, horseradish, essence of anchovy, Cayenne,
&amp;c.: plain sauces are only to taste of the ingredient from which they
derive their name.</p>

<p><a name="obs-278" id="obs-278"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;It will very much heighten the flavour of this sauce to pound
the soft part of half a dozen (unboiled) oysters; rub it through a
hair-sieve, and then stir it into the sauce: this essence of oyster (and
for some palates a few grains of Cayenne) is the only addition we
recommend. See <a href="#no_441">No. 441</a>.</p>

<p>Open the oysters carefully, so as not to cut them except in dividing the
gristle which attaches the shells; put them into a mortar, and when you
have got as many as you can conveniently pound at once, add about two
drachms of salt to a dozen oysters; pound them, and rub them through
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> back of a hair-sieve, and put them into a mortar again, with as
much flour (which has been previously thoroughly dried) as will make
them into a paste; roll it out several times, and, lastly, flour it, and
roll it out the thickness of a half-crown, and divide it into pieces
about an inch square; lay them in a Dutch oven, where they will dry so
gently as not to get burnt: turn them every half hour, and when they
begin to dry, crumble them; they will take about four hours to dry; then
pound them fine, sift them, and put them into bottles, and seal them
over.</p>

<p><a name="nb-280" id="nb-280"></a>N.B. Three dozen of natives required 7<span class="hide">&nbsp;</span><span class="num">1</span>/<span class="den">2</span> ounces of dried flour to make
them into a paste, which then weighed 11 ounces; when dried and
powdered, 6<span class="hide">&nbsp;</span><span class="num">1</span>/<span class="den">4</span> ounces.</p>

<p>To make half a pint of sauce, put one ounce of butter into a stew-pan
with three drachms of oyster powder, and six table-spoonfuls of milk;
set it on a slow fire; stir it till it boils, and season it with salt.</p>

<p>This powder, if made with plump, juicy natives, will abound with the
flavour of the fish; and if closely corked, and kept in a dry place,
will remain good for some time.</p>

<p><a name="obs-280" id="obs-280"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;This extract is a welcome succedaneum while oysters are out of
season, and in such inland parts as seldom have any, is a valuable
addition to the list of fish sauces: it is equally good with boiled
fowl, or rump steak, and sprinkled on bread and butter makes a very good
sandwich, and is especially worthy the notice of country housekeepers,
and as a store sauce for the army and navy. See Anchovy Powder, <a href="#no_435">No. 435</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Shrimp Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_283" id="no_283"></a>No. 283.)</h3>

<p>Shell a pint of shrimps; pick them clean, wash them, and put them into
half a pint of good melted butter. A pint of unshelled shrimps is about
enough for four persons.</p>

<p><a name="obs-283" id="obs-283"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Some stew the heads and shells of the shrimps, (with or without
a blade of bruised mace,) for a quarter of an hour, and strain off the
liquor to melt the butter with, and add a little lemon-juice, Cayenne,
and essence of anchovy, or soy, cavice, &amp;c.; but the flavour of the
shrimp is so delicate, that it will be overcome by any such additions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span>&mdash;If your shrimps are not quite fresh, they will eat tough and
thready, as other stale fish do. See <a href="#obs-140"><i>Obs.</i></a> to <a href="#no_140">No. 140</a>.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Lobster Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_284" id="no_284"></a>No. 284.)</h3>

<p>Choose a fine spawny hen lobster;<a name="FNanchor_236-1_183" id="FNanchor_236-1_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_236-1_183" class="fnanchor">236-*</a> be sure it is fresh, so get a
live one if you can, (one of my culinary predecessors says, &#8220;let it be
heavy and lively,&#8221;) and boil it as <a href="#no_176">No. 176</a>; pick out the spawn and the
red coral into a mortar, add to it half an ounce of butter, pound it
quite smooth, and rub it through a hair-sieve with the back of a wooden
spoon; cut the meat of the lobster into small squares, or pull it to
pieces with a fork; put the pounded spawn into as much melted butter
(<a href="#no_256">No. 256</a>) as you think will do, and stir it together till it is
thoroughly mixed; now put to it the meat of the lobster, and warm it on
the fire; take care it does not boil, which will spoil its complexion,
and its brilliant red colour will immediately fade.</p>

<p>The above is a very easy and excellent manner of making this sauce.</p>

<p>Some use strong beef or veal gravy instead of melted butter, adding
anchovy, Cayenne, catchup, cavice, lemon-juice, or pickle, or wine, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="obs-284" id="obs-284"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Save a little of the inside red coral spawn, and rub it through
a sieve (without butter): it is a very ornamental garnish to sprinkle
over fish; and if the skin is broken, (which will sometimes happen to
the most careful cook, when there is a large dinner to dress, and many
other things to attend to,) you will find it a convenient and elegant
veil, to conceal your misfortune from the prying eyes of piscivorous
<i>gourmands</i>.</p>

<p><a name="nb-284" id="nb-284"></a>N.B. Various methods have been tried to preserve lobsters, see <a href="#no_178">No. 178</a>,
and lobster spawn, for a store sauce. The live spawn may be kept some
time in strong salt and water, or in an ice-house.</p>

<p>The following process might, perhaps, preserve it longer. Put it into a
saucepan of boiling water, with a large spoonful of salt in it, and let
it boil quick for five minutes; then drain it on a hair-sieve; spread it
out thin on a plate, and set it in a Dutch oven till it is thoroughly
dried; grind it in a clean mill, and pack it closely in well-stopped
bottles. See also Potted Lobsters, <a href="#no_178">No. 178</a>.</p>

<p>Bruise the yelks of two hard-boiled eggs with the back of a wooden

boil it five minutes in five table-spoonfuls of water; chop it fine, or
pound or bruise it in a small quantity of the liquor it was boiled in,
and rub it through a sieve: wash about one-third the bulk of parsley
leaves, put them on to boil in a little boiling water, with a
tea-spoonful of salt in it; lay it on a hair-sieve to drain, and mince
it very fine; mix it with the liver, and put it into a quarter pint of

<h3 class="recipe"><i>To make Lemon and Liver Sauce.</i></h3>

<p>Pare off the rind of a lemon, or of a Seville orange, as thin as

the white, and cut the lemon into slices, about as thick as a couple of
half-crowns; pick out the pips, and divide the slices into small
squares: add these, and a little of the peel minced very fine to the
liver, prepared as directed above, and put them into the melted butter,

you wish.</p>

<p><a name="obs-287" id="obs-287"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Some cooks, instead of pounding, mince the liver very fine (with
half as much bacon), and leave out the parsley; others add the juice of
half a lemon, and some of the peel grated, or a tea-spoonful of tarragon
or Chili vinegar, a table-spoonful of white wine, or a little beaten
mace, or nutmeg, or allspice: if you wish it a little more lively on the

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Browning</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_322" id="no_322"></a>No. 322.)</h3>

<p>Is a convenient article to colour those soups or sauces of which it is
supposed their deep brown complexion denotes the strength and
savouriness of the composition.</p>

<p>Burned sugar is also a favourite ingredient with the brewers, who use it
under the name of &#8220;essentia bina&#8221; to colour their beer: it is also
employed by the brandy-makers, in considerable quantity, to colour
brandy; to which, besides enriching its complexion, it gives that
sweetish taste, and fulness in the mouth, which custom has taught brandy
drinkers to admire, and prefer to the finest Cognac in its genuine
state.</p>

<p>When employed for culinary purposes, this is sometimes made with strong
gravy, or walnut catchup. Those who like a <i>go&ucirc;t</i> of acid may add a
little walnut pickle.</p>

<p>It will hardly be told from what is commonly called &#8220;genuine Japanese
soy&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_246-1_187" id="FNanchor_246-1_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_246-1_187" class="fnanchor">246-*</a> (for which it is a very good substitute). Burned treacle or
sugar, the peels of walnut, Cayenne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> pepper, or capsicums, or Chilies,
vinegar, garlic, and pickled herrings (especially the Dutch), Sardinias,
or sprats, appear to be the bases of almost all the sauces which now (to
use the maker&#8217;s phrase) stand unrivalled.</p>

<p>Although indefatigable research and experiment have put us in possession
of these compositions, it would not be quite fair to enrich the cook at
the expense of the oilman, &amp;c.; we hope we have said enough on these
subjects to satisfy &#8220;the rational epicure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Put half a pound of pounded lump-sugar, and a table-spoonful of water,
into a clean iron saucepan, set it over a slow fire, and keep stirring
it with a wooden spoon till it becomes a bright brown colour, and begins
to smoke; then add to it an ounce of salt, and dilute it by degrees with
water, till it is the thickness of soy; let it boil, take off the scum,
and strain the liquor into bottles, which must be well stopped: if you
have not any of this by you, and you wish to darken the colour of your
sauces, pound a tea-spoonful of lump-sugar, and put it into an iron
spoon, with as much water as will dissolve it; hold it over a quick fire
till it becomes of a very dark brown colour; mix it with the soup, &amp;c.
while it is hot.</p>

<p><a name="obs-322" id="obs-322"></a><i>Obs.</i> Most of the preparations under this title are a medley of burned
butter, spices, catchup, wine, &amp;c. We recommend the rational epicure to
be content with the natural colour of soups and sauces, which, to a
well-educated palate, are much more agreeable, without any of these
empyreumatic additions; however they may please the eye, they plague the
stomach most grievously; so &#8220;open your mouth and shut your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the sake of producing a pretty colour, &#8220;cheese,&#8221; &#8220;Cayenne&#8221; (<a href="#no_404">No.
404</a>), &#8220;essence of anchovy&#8221; (<a href="#no_433">No. 433</a>), &amp;c. are frequently adulterated

<p>A scientific &#8220;<i>homme de bouche de France</i>&#8221; observes: &#8220;The generality of
cooks calcine bones, till they are as black as a coal, and throw them
hissing hot into the stew-pan, to give a brown colour to their broths.
These ingredients, under the appearance of a nourishing gravy, envelope
our food with stimulating acid and corrosive poison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roux, or thickening (<a href="#no_257">No. 257</a>), if not made very carefully, produces
exactly the same effect; and the juices of beef or veal, burned over a
hot fire, to give a rich colour to soup or sauces, grievously offend the
stomach, and create the most distressing indigestions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>&#8220;The judicious cook will refuse the help of these incendiary articles,
which ignorance or quackery only employ; not only at the expense of the
credit of the cook, but the health of her employers.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="nb-322" id="nb-322"></a>N.B. The best browning is good home-made glaze (<a href="#no_252">No. 252</a>), mushroom
catchup (<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), or claret, or port wine. See also <a href="#no_257">No. 257</a>; or cut
meat into slices, and broil them brown, and then stew them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Gravy for roast Meat.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_326" id="no_326"></a>No. 326.)</h3>

<p>Most joints will afford sufficient trimmings, &amp;c. to make half a pint of
plain gravy, which you may colour with a few drops of <a href="#no_322">No. 322</a>: for those
that do not, about half an hour before you think the meat will be done,
mix a salt-spoonful of salt, with a full quarter pint of boiling water;
drop this by degrees on the brown parts of the joint; set a dish under
to catch it (the meat will soon brown again); set it by; as it cools,
the fat will float on the surface; when the meat is ready, carefully
remove the fat, and warm up the gravy, and pour it into the dish.</p>

<p>The common method is, when the meat is in the dish you intend to send it
up in, to mix half a tea-spoonful of salt in a quarter pint of boiling
water, and to drop some of this over the corners and underside of the
meat, and to pour the rest through the hole the spit came out of: some
pierce the inferior parts of the joints with a sharp skewer.</p>

<p>The following receipt was given us by a very good cook: You may make
good browning for roast meat and poultry, by saving the brown bits of
roast meat or broiled; cut them small, put them into a basin, cover them
with boiling water, and put them away till next day; then put it into a
saucepan, let it boil two or three minutes, strain it through a sieve
into a basin, and put it away for use. When you want gravy for roast
meat, put two table-spoonfuls into half a pint of boiling water with a
little salt: if for roasted veal, put three table-spoonfuls into half a
pint of thin melted butter.</p>

<p><a name="nb-326" id="nb-326"></a>N.B. The gravy which comes down in the dish, the cook (if she is a good
housewife) will preserve to enrich hashes or little made dishes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If you want gravy immediately, see <a href="#no_307">No. 307</a>, or <a href="#no_252">No. 252</a>. If you have time
enough, furnish a thick and well-tinned stew-pan with a thin slice of
fat ham or bacon, or an ounce of butter, and a middling-sized onion; on
this lay a pound of nice, juicy gravy <a name="corr57" id="corr57"></a>beef, (as the object in making
gravy is to extract the nutritious succulence of the meat, it must be
beaten to comminute the containing vessels, and scored to augment the
surface to the action of the water); cover the stew-pan, and set it on a
slow fire; when the meat begins to brown, turn it about, and let it get
slightly browned (but take care it is not at all burned): then pour in a
pint and a half of boiling water; set the pan on the fire; when it
boils, carefully catch the scum, and then put in a crust of bread
toasted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> brown (don&#8217;t burn it), a sprig of winter savoury, or
lemon-thyme and parsley, a roll of thin-cut lemon-peel, a dozen berries
of allspice, and a dozen of black pepper; cover the stew-pan close, let
it stew very gently for about two hours, then strain it through a sieve
into a basin.</p>

<p>If you wish to thicken it, set a clean stew-pan over a slow fire, with
about an ounce of butter in it; when it is melted, dredge to it (by
degrees) as much flour as will dry it up, stirring them well together;
when thoroughly mixed, pour in a little of the gravy; stir it well
together, and add the remainder by degrees; set it over the fire, let it
simmer gently for fifteen or twenty minutes longer, and skim off the
fat, &amp;c. as it rises; when it is about as thick as cream, squeeze it
through a tamis, or fine sieve, and you will have a fine, rich brown
sauce, at a very moderate expense, and without much trouble.</p>

<p><a name="obs-329" id="obs-329"></a><i>Obs.</i> If you wish to make it still more relishing, if it is for
poultry, you may pound the liver with a bit of butter, rub it through a

<p>For a rago&ucirc;t or game, add at the same time a table-spoonful of mushroom

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Poivrade Sauce.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_365" id="no_365"></a>No. 365.)</h3>

<p>This, as its title tells us, is a sauce of French extraction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> The
following receipt is from &#8220;<i>La Cuisini&egrave;re Bourgeoise</i>,&#8221; page 408.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put a bit of butter as big as an egg into a stew-pan with two or three
bits of onion, carrot, and turnip, cut in slices, two eschalots, two
cloves, a bay-leaf, thyme, and basil; keep turning them in the pan till
they get a little colour; shake in some flour, and add a glass of red
wine, a glass of water, a spoonful of vinegar, and a little pepper and
salt; boil half an hour; skim and strain it.&#8221;</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Mustard in a minute.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_369" id="no_369"></a>No. 369.)</h3>

<p>Mix very gradually, and rub together in a mortar, an ounce of flour of
mustard, with three table-spoonfuls of milk (cream is better), half a
tea-spoonful of salt, and the same of sugar; rub them well together till
quite smooth.</p>

<p><a name="obs-369" id="obs-369"></a><i>Obs.</i> Mustard made in this manner is not at all bitter, and is
therefore instantly ready for the table.</p>

<p><a name="nb-369" id="nb-369"></a>N.B. It has been said that flour of mustard is sometimes adulterated
with common flour, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Mustard.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_370" id="no_370"></a>No. 370.)</h3>

<p>Mix (by degrees, by rubbing together in a mortar) the best Durham flour
of mustard, with vinegar, white wine, or cold water, in which scraped
horseradish has been boiled; rub it well together for at least ten
minutes, till it is perfectly smooth; it will keep in a stone jar
closely stopped, for a fortnight: only put as much into the mustard-pot
as will be used in a day or two.</p>

<p>The ready-made mustard prepared at the oil shops is mixed with about
one-fourth part salt: this is done to preserve it, if it is to be kept
long; otherwise, by all means, omit it. The best way of eating salt is
in substance.</p>

<p><a name="obs-370" id="obs-370"></a><i>Obs.</i> Mustard is the best of all the stimulants that are employed to
give energy to the digestive organs. It was in high favour with our
forefathers; in the <i>Northumberland Household Book</i> for 1512, p. 18, is
an order for an annual supply of 160 gallons of mustard.</p>

<p>Some opulent epicures mix it with sherry or Madeira wine, or distilled
or flavoured vinegar, instead of horseradish water.</p>

<p>The French flavour their mustard with Champaigne and other wines, or
with vinegar flavoured with capers, anchovies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> tarragon, elder, basil,
burnet, garlic, eschalot, or celery, see <a href="#no_395">No. 395</a> to <a href="#no_402">No. 402</a>: warming it

<p>Common salt is more relishing than basket salt; it should be prepared
for the table by drying it in a Dutch oven before the fire; then put it
on a clean paper, and roll it with a rolling pin; if you pound it in a

<p>Endeavour to have your salad herbs as fresh as possible; if you suspect
they are not &#8220;morning gathered,&#8221; they will be much refreshed by lying an
hour or two in spring-water; then carefully wash and pick them, and trim
off all the worm-eaten, slimy, cankered, dry leaves; and, after washing,
let them remain a while in the colander to drain: lastly, swing them
gently in a clean napkin: when properly picked and cut, arrange them in
the salad dish, mix the sauce in a soup plate, and put it into an
ingredient bottle,<a name="FNanchor_260-1_192" id="FNanchor_260-1_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_260-1_192" class="fnanchor">260-*</a> or pour it down the side of the salad dish,
and don&#8217;t stir it up till the mouths are ready for it.</p>

<p>If the herbs be young, fresh gathered, trimmed neatly, and drained dry,
and the sauce-maker ponders patiently over the following directions, he
cannot fail obtaining the fame of being a very accomplished
salad-dresser.</p>

<p>Boil a couple of eggs for twelve minutes, and put them in a basin of
cold water for a few minutes; the yelks must be quite cold and hard, or
they will not incorporate with the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>gredients. Rub them through a
sieve with a wooden spoon, and mix them with a table-spoonful of water,
or fine double cream; then add two table-spoonfuls of oil or melted
butter; when these are well mixed, add, by degrees, a tea-spoonful of
salt, or powdered lump sugar, and the same of made mustard: when these
are smoothly united, add very gradually three table-spoonfuls of
vinegar; rub it with the other ingredients till thoroughly incorporated
with them; cut up the white of the egg, and garnish the top of the salad
with it. Let the sauce remain at the bottom of the bowl, and do not stir
up the salad till it is to be eaten: we recommend the eaters to be
mindful of the duty of mastication, without the due performance of
which, all undressed vegetables are troublesome company for the
principal viscera, and some are even dangerously indigestible.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Boiled Salad.</i></h3>

<p>This is best compounded of boiled or baked onions (if Portugal the
better), some baked beet-root, cauliflower, or broccoli, and boiled
celery and French beans, or any of these articles, with the common salad
dressing; added to this, to give it an enticing appearance, and to give
some of the crispness and freshness so pleasant in salad, a small
quantity of raw endive, or lettuce and chervil, or burnet, strewed on
the top: this is by far more wholesome than the raw salad, and is much
eaten when put on the table.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-261" id="nb-p-261"></a>N.B. The above sauce is equally good with cold meat, cold fish, or for
cucumbers, celery, radishes, &amp;c. and all the other vegetables that are
sent to table undressed: to the above, a little minced onion is
generally an acceptable addition.</p>

<p><a name="obs-p-261" id="obs-p-261"></a><i>Obs.</i> Salad is a very compound dish with our neighbours the French, who
always add to the mixture above, black pepper, and sometimes savoury
spice.</p>

<p>The Italians mince the white meat of chickens into this sauce.</p>

<p>The Dutch, cold boiled turbot or lobster; or add to it a spoonful of
grated parmesan or old Cheshire cheese, or mince very fine a little
tarragon, or chervil, burnet, or young onion, celery, or pickled
gherkins, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Joan Cromwell&#8217;s grand salad was composed of equal parts of almonds,
raisins, capers, pickled cucumbers, shrimps, and boiled turnips.</p>

<p>This mixture is sometimes made with cream, oiled butter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span> (see <a href="#no_260-1">No. 260*</a>),

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Forcemeat Stuffings.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_373" id="no_373"></a>No. 373.)</h3>

<p>Forcemeat is now considered an indispensable accompaniment to most made
dishes, and when composed with good taste, gives additional spirit and
relish to even that &#8220;sovereign of savouriness,&#8221; turtle soup.</p>

<p>It is also sent up in patties, and for stuffing of veal, game, poultry,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The ingredients should be so proportioned, that no one flavour
predominates.</p>

<p>To give the same stuffing for veal, hare, &amp;c. argues a poverty of
invention; with a little contrivance, you may make as great a variety as
you have dishes.</p>

<p>I have given receipts for some of the most favourite compositions, and a
table of materials, a glance at which will enable the ingenious cook to
make an infinite variety of combinations: the first column containing
the spirit, the second the substance of them.</p>

<p>The poignancy of forcemeat should be proportioned to the savouriness of
the viands, to which it is intended to give an additional zest. Some
dishes require a very delicately flavoured forcemeat, for others, it
must be full and high seasoned. What would be <i>piquante</i> in a turkey,
would be insipid with turtle.</p>

<p>Tastes are so different, and the praise the cook receives will depend so
much on her pleasing the palate of those she works for, that all her
sagacity must be on the alert, to produce the flavours to which her
employers are partial. See pages <a href="#Page_45">45</a> and <a href="#Page_46">46</a>.</p>

<p>Most people have an acquired and peculiar taste in stuffings, &amp;c., and
what exactly pleases one, seldom is precisely what another considers the
most agreeable: and after all the contrivance of a pains-taking
palatician, to combine her &#8220;<i>hauts go&ucirc;ts</i>&#8221; in the most harmonious
proportions,</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;The very dish one likes the best,<br />
Is acid, or insipid, to the <a name="corr61" id="corr61"></a>rest.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Custom is all in all in matters of taste: it is not that one person is
naturally fond of this or that, and another naturally averse to it; but
that one is used to it, and another is not.</p>

<p>The consistency of forcemeats is rather a difficult thing to manage;
they are almost always either too light or too heavy.</p>

<p>Take care to pound it till perfectly smooth, and that all the
ingredients are thoroughly incorporated.</p>

<p>Forcemeat-balls must not be larger than a small nutmeg. If they are for
brown sauce, flour and fry them; if for white, put them into boiling
water, and boil them for three minutes: the latter are by far the most
delicate.</p>

<p><a name="nb-373" id="nb-373"></a>N.B. If not of sufficient stiffness, it falls to pieces, and makes soup,
&amp;c. grouty and very unsightly.</p>

<p>Sweetbreads and tongues are the favourite materials for forcemeat.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cayenne Pepper.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_404" id="no_404"></a>No. 404.)</h3>

<p>Mr. Accum has informed the public (see his book on Adulterations) that
from some specimens that came direct to him from India, and others
obtained from respectable oil shops in London, he has extracted lead!</p>

<p>&#8220;Foreign Cayenne pepper is an indiscriminate mixture of the powder of
the dried pods of many species of capsicums, especially of the bird
pepper, which is the hottest of all. As it comes to us from the West
Indies, it changes the infusion of turnsole to a beautiful green,
probably owing to the salt, which is always added to it, and the red
oxide of lead, with which it is said to be adulterated.&#8221; <span class="smcap">Duncan&#8217;s</span> <i>New
Edinburgh Dispensary</i>, 1819, Article <i>Capsicum</i>, p. 81.</p>

<p>The Indian Cayenne is prepared in a very careless manner, and often
looks as if the pods had lain till they were decayed, before they were
dried: this accounts for the dirty brown appearance it commonly has. If
properly dried as soon as gathered, it will be of a clear red colour: to
give it the complexion of that made with good fresh-gathered capsicums
or Chilies, some annatto, or other vegetable red colouring matter, is
pounded with it: this, Mr. A. assures us, is frequently adulterated with
Indian red, <i>i. e.</i> &#8220;red lead!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Cayenne is pounded, it is mixed with a considerable portion of
salt, to prevent its flying up and hurting the eyes: this might be
avoided by grinding it in a mill, which may easily be made close enough,
especially if it be passed through a second time, and then sifted
through a fine drum-headed sieve, to produce as fine a powder as can be
obtained by pounding; however, our English chilies may be pounded in a
deep mortar without any danger.</p>

<p>The flavour of the Chilies is very superior to that of the capsicums,
and will be good in proportion as they are dried as soon as possible,
taking care they are not burned.</p>

<p>Take away the stalks, and put the pods into a colander; set it before
the fire; they will take full twelve hours to dry, then put them into a
mortar, with one-fourth their weight of salt, and pound them, and rub
them till they are fine as possible, and put them into a well-stopped
bottle.</p>

<p><a name="nb-404" id="nb-404"></a>N.B. We advise those who are fond of Cayenne not to think it too much
trouble to make it of English Chilies; there is no other way of being
sure it is genuine, and they will obtain a pepper of much finer flavour,
without half the heat of the foreign.</p>

<p>A hundred large Chilies, costing only two shillings, will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> produce you
about two ounces of Cayenne, so it is as cheap as the commonest Cayenne.</p>

<p>Four hundred Chilies, when the stems were taken off, weighed half a
pound; and when dried, produced a quarter of a pound of Cayenne pepper.</p>

of loaf sugar, and rub them till all the yellow rind is taken up by the
sugar: scrape off the surface of the sugar into a preserving pot, and
press it hard down; cover it very close, and it will keep for some
time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>In the same way you may get the essence of Seville orange-peel.</p>

<p><a name="obs-407" id="obs-407"></a><i>Obs.</i> This method of procuring and preserving the flavour of
lemon-peel, by making an <i>oleo-saccharum</i>, is far superior to the common

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Artificial Lemon-juice.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_407-1" id="no_407-1"></a>No. 407*.)</h3>

<p>If you add a drachm of lump sugar, pounded, and six drops of <a href="#no_408">No. 408</a>, to
three ounces of crystal vinegar, which is the name given to the
pyroligneous vinegar, you will have an excellent substitute for
lemon-juice&mdash;for fish sauces and soups, and many other culinary
purposes. The flavour of the lemon may also be communicated to the
vinegar by infusing some lemon-peel in it.</p>

<p><a name="nb-407-1" id="nb-407-1"></a>N.B. The pyroligneous vinegar is perfectly free from all flavour, save
that of the pure acid; therefore, it is a very valuable menstruum for
receiving impregnations from various flavouring materials.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Quintessence of Anchovy.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_433" id="no_433"></a>No. 433.)</h3>

<p>The goodness of this preparation depends almost entirely on having fine
mellow fish, that have been in pickle long enough (<i>i. e.</i> about twelve
months) to dissolve easily, yet are not at all rusty.</p>

<p>Choose those that are in the state they come over in, not such as have
been put into fresh pickle, mixed with red paint,<a name="FNanchor_280-1_199" id="FNanchor_280-1_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_280-1_199" class="fnanchor">280-*</a> which some add
to improve the complexion of the fish; it has been said, that others
have a trick of putting anchovy liquor on pickled sprats;<a name="FNanchor_280-2_200" id="FNanchor_280-2_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_280-2_200" class="fnanchor">280-&#8224;</a> you
will easily discover this by washing one of them, and tasting the flesh
of it, which in the fine anchovy is mellow, red, and high-flavoured, and
the bone moist and oily. Make only as much as will soon be used, the
fresher it is the better.</p>

<p>Put ten or twelve anchovies into a mortar, and pound them to a pulp; put
this into a very clean iron, or silver, or very well tinned saucepan;
then put a large table-spoonful of cold spring-water (we prefer good
vinegar) into the mortar; shake it round, and pour it to the pounded
anchovies, set them by the side of a slow fire, very frequently stirring
them together till they are melted, which they will be in the course of
five minutes. Now stir in a quarter of a drachm of good Cayenne pepper
(<a href="#no_404">No. 404</a>). and let it remain by the side of the fire for a few minutes
longer; then, while it is warm, rub it through a hair-sieve,<a name="FNanchor_280-3_201" id="FNanchor_280-3_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_280-3_201" class="fnanchor">280-&#8225;</a>
with the back of a wooden spoon.</p>

<p>The essence of anchovy, which is prepared for the committee of taste, is
made with double the above quantity of water, as they are of opinion
that it ought to be so thin as not to hang about the sides of the
bottle; when it does, the large surface of it is soon acted upon by the
air, and becomes rancid and spoils all the rest of it.</p>

<p>A roll of thin-cut lemon-peel infused with the anchovy, imparts a fine,
fresh, delicate, aromatic flavour, which is very grateful; this is only
recommended when you make sauce for immediate use; it will keep much
better without: if you wish to acidulate it, instead of water make it
with artificial lemon-juice (<a href="#no_407-1">No. 407*</a>), or add a little of Coxwell&#8217;s
concrete acid to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;The above is the proper way to perfectly dissolve
anchovy,<a name="FNanchor_281-1_202" id="FNanchor_281-1_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_281-1_202" class="fnanchor">281-*</a> and to incorporate it with the water; which, if
completely saturated, will continue suspended.</p>

<p>To prevent the separation of essence of anchovy, and give it the
appearance of being fully saturated with fish, various other expedients
have been tried, such as dissolving the fish in thin water gruel, or
barley-water, or thickening it with mucilage, flour, &amp;c.: when any of
these things are added, it does not keep half so well as it does without
them; and to preserve it, they overload it with Cayenne pepper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span>&mdash;You cannot make essence of anchovy half so cheap as you can buy
it. Thirty prime fish, weighing a pound and a quarter, and costing 4<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>, and two table-spoonfuls of water, made me only half a pint of
essence; you may commonly buy that quantity ready-made for 2<i>s.</i>, and we
have seen an advertisement offering it for sale as low as 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per quart.</p>

<p>It must be kept very closely stopped; when you tap a bottle of sauce,
throw away the old perforated cork, and put in a new taper velvet cork;
if the air gets to it, the fish takes the rust,<a name="FNanchor_281-2_203" id="FNanchor_281-2_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_281-2_203" class="fnanchor">281-&#8224;</a> and it is spoiled
directly.</p>

<p>Essence of anchovy is sometimes coloured<a name="FNanchor_281-3_204" id="FNanchor_281-3_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_281-3_204" class="fnanchor">281-&#8225;</a> with bole armeniac,
Venice red, <a name="corr64" id="corr64"></a>&amp;c.; but all these additions deteriorate the flavour of the
sauce, and the palate and stomach suffer for the gratification of the
eye, which, in culinary concerns, will never be indulged by the
sagacious gourmand at the expense of these two <i>primum mobiles</i> of his
pursuits.</p>

<p><sup class="astsup">*</sup><sub class="astsub">*</sub><sup class="astsup">*</sup> Essence of anchovy is sometimes made with sherry or Madeira wine, or
good mushroom catchup (<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), instead of water. If you like the acid
flavour, add a little citric acid, or dissolve them in good vinegar.</p>

<p><a name="nb-433" id="nb-433"></a>N.B. This is infinitely the most convenient way of using anchovy, as
each guest may mix sauce for himself, and make it strong or weak,
according to his own taste.</p>

<p>It is also much more economical, as plain melted butter (<a href="#no_256">No. 256</a>) serves
for other purposes at table.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Walnut Catchup.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_438" id="no_438"></a>No. 438.)</h3>

<p>Take six half-sieves of green walnut-shells, put them into a tub, mix
them up well with common salt, (from two to three pounds,) let them
stand for six days, frequently beating and mashing them; by this time
the shells become soft and pulpy; then by banking it up on one side of
the tub, and at the same time by raising the tub on that side, the
liquor will drain clear off to the other; then take that liquor out: the
mashing and banking-up may be repeated as often as liquor is found. The
quantity will be about six quarts. When done, let it be simmered in an
iron boiler as long as any scum arises; then bruise a quarter of a pound
of ginger, a quarter of a pound of allspice, two ounces of long pepper,
two ounces of cloves, with the above ingredients; let it slowly boil for
half an hour; when bottled, let an equal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> quantity of the spice go into
each bottle; when corked, let the bottles be filled quite up: cork them
tight, seal them over, and put them into a cool and dry place for one
year before they are used.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Mushroom Catchup.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_439" id="no_439"></a>No. 439.)</h3>

<p>If you love good catchup, gentle reader, make it yourself,<a name="FNanchor_283-1_205" id="FNanchor_283-1_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_283-1_205" class="fnanchor">283-*</a> after
the following directions, and you will have a delicious relish for
made-dishes, rago&ucirc;ts, soups, sauces, or hashes.</p>

<p>Mushroom gravy approaches the nature and flavour of meat gravy, more
than any vegetable juice, and is the superlative substitute for it: in
meagre soups and extempore gravies, the chemistry of the kitchen has yet
contrived to agreeably awaken the palate, and encourage the appetite.</p>

<p>A couple of quarts of double catchup, made according to the following
receipt, will save you some score pounds of meat, besides a vast deal of
time and trouble; as it will furnish, in a few minutes, as good sauce as
can be made for either fish, flesh, or fowl. See <a href="#no_307">No. 307</a>.</p>

<p>I believe the following is the best way of extracting and preparing the
essence of mushrooms, so as to procure and preserve their flavour for a
considerable length of time.</p>

<p>Look out for mushrooms from the beginning of September.</p>

<p>Take care they are the right sort, and fresh gathered. Full-grown flaps
are to be preferred: put a layer of these at the bottom of a deep
earthen pan, and sprinkle them with salt; then another layer of
mushrooms, and some more salt on them; and so on alternately, salt and
mushrooms: let them remain two or three hours, by which time the salt
will have penetrated the mushrooms, and rendered them easy to break;
then pound them in a mortar, or mash them well with your hands, and let
them remain for a couple of days, not longer, stirring them up and
mashing them well each day; then pour them into a stone jar, and to each
quart add an ounce and a half of whole black pepper, and half an ounce
of allspice; stop the jar very close, and set it in a stew-pan of
boiling water, and keep it boiling for two hours at least.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> Take out the
jar, and pour the juice clear from the settlings through a hair-sieve
(without squeezing<a name="FNanchor_284-1_206" id="FNanchor_284-1_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_284-1_206" class="fnanchor">284-*</a> the mushrooms) into a clean stew-pan; let it
boil very gently for half an hour: those who are for superlative
catchup, will continue the boiling till the mushroom-juice is reduced to
half the quantity; it may then be called double cat-sup or dog-sup.</p>

<p>There are several advantages attending this concentration; it will keep
much better, and only half the quantity be required; so you can flavour
sauce, &amp;c. without thinning it: neither is this an extravagant way of
making it, for merely the aqueous part is evaporated; skim it well, and
pour it into a clean dry jar, or jug; cover it close, and let it stand
in a cool place till next day; then pour it off as gently as possible
(so as not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the jug,) through a
tamis, or thick flannel bag, till it is perfectly clear; add a
table-spoonful of good brandy to each pint of catchup, and let it stand
as before; a fresh sediment will be deposited, from which the catchup is
to be quietly poured off, and bottled in pints or half pints (which have
been washed with brandy or spirit): it is best to keep it in such
quantities as are soon used.</p>

<p>Take especial care that it is closely corked, and sealed down, or dipped
in bottle cement.</p>

<p>If kept in a cool, dry place, it may be preserved for a long time; but
if it be badly corked, and kept in a damp place, it will soon spoil.</p>

<p>Examine it from time to time, by placing a strong light behind the neck
of the bottle, and if any pellicle appears about it, boil it up again
with a few peppercorns.</p>

<p>We have ordered no more spice, &amp;c. than is absolutely necessary to feed
the catchup, and keep it from fermenting, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The compound, commonly called catchup, is generally an injudicious
combination of so many different tastes, that the flavour of the
mushroom is overpowered by a farrago of garlic, eschalot, anchovy,
mustard, horseradish, lemon-peel, beer, wine, spice, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="obs-439" id="obs-439"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;A table-spoonful of double catchup will impregnate half a pint
of sauce with the full flavour of mushroom, in much greater perfection
than either pickled or powder of mushrooms.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Quintessence of Mushrooms.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_440" id="no_440"></a>No. 440.)</h3>

<p>This delicate relish is made by sprinkling a little salt over either
flap or button mushrooms; three hours after, mash them; next day, strain
off the liquor that will flow from them; put it into a stew-pan, and
boil it till it is reduced to half.</p>

<p>It will not keep long, but is preferable to any of the catchups, which,
in order to preserve them, must have spice, &amp;c., which overpowers the
flavour of the mushrooms.</p>

<p>An artificial mushroom bed will supply this all the year round.</p>

<p>To make sauce with this, see <a href="#no_307">No. 307</a>.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Oyster Catchup.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_441" id="no_441"></a>No. 441.)</h3>

<p>Take fine fresh Milton oysters; wash them in their own liquor; skim it;
pound them in a marble mortar; to a pint of oysters add a pint of
sherry; boil them up, and add an ounce of salt, two drachms of pounded
mace, and one of Cayenne; let it just boil up again; skim it, and rub it
through a sieve, and when cold, bottle it, cork it well, and seal it
down.</p>

<p><a name="nb-441" id="nb-441"></a>N.B. It is the best way to pound the salt and spices, &amp;c. with the
oysters.</p>

<p><a name="obs-441-1" id="obs-441-1"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;This composition very agreeably heightens the flavour of white
sauces, and white made-dishes; and if you add a glass of brandy to it,
it will keep good for a considerable time longer than oysters are out of
season in England.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cockle and Muscle Catchup</i>,&mdash;(<a name="no_442" id="no_442"></a>No. 442.)</h3>

<p>May be made by treating them in the same way as the oysters in the
preceding receipt.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Pudding Catchup.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_446" id="no_446"></a>No. 446.)</h3>

<p>Half a pint of brandy, &#8220;essence of punch&#8221; (<a href="#no_479">No. 479</a>), or &#8220;Cura&ccedil;oa&#8221; (<a href="#no_474">No.
474</a>), or &#8220;Noyeau,&#8221; a pint of sherry, an ounce of thin-pared lemon-peel,
half an ounce of mace, and steep them for fourteen days, then strain it,
and add a quarter of a pint of capillaire, or <a href="#no_476">No. 476</a>. This will keep
for years, and, mixed with melted butter, is a delicious relish to
puddings and sweet dishes. See Pudding Sauce, <a href="#no_269">No. 269</a>, and the Justice&#8217;s

<p>Peel and wash a pound of full-grown potatoes, grate them on a
bread-grater into a deep dish, containing a quart of clear water; stir
it well up, and then pour it through a hair-sieve, and leave it ten
minutes to settle, till the water is quite clear: then pour off the
water, and put a quart of fresh water to it; stir it up, let it settle,
and repeat this till the water is quite clear; you will at last find a
fine white powder at the bottom of the vessel. (The criterion of this
process being completed, is the purity of the water that comes from it
after stirring it up.) Lay this on a sheet of paper in a hair-sieve to
dry, either in the sun or before the fire, and it is ready for use, and
in a well-stopped bottle will keep good for many months.</p>

<p>If this be well made, half an ounce (<i>i. e.</i> a table-spoonful) of it
mixed with two table-spoonfuls of cold water, and stirred into a soup or
sauce, just before you take it up, will thicken a pint of it to the
consistence of cream.</p>

<p><a name="obs-448" id="obs-448"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;This preparation much resembles the &#8220;Indian arrow root,&#8221; and is
a good substitute for it; it gives a fulness on the palate to gravies
and sauces at hardly any expense, and by some is used to thicken melted
butter instead of flour.</p>

<p>As it is perfectly tasteless, it will not alter the flavour of the most
delicate broth, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Of the Flour of Potatoes.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;A patent has been recently obtained at Paris, a gold medal bestowed,
and other honorary distinctions granted, for the discovery and practice,
on a large scale, of preparing from potatoes a fine flour; a sago, a
flour equal to ground rice; and a semolina or paste, of which 1<i>lb.</i> is
equal to 1<span class="hide">&nbsp;</span><span class="num">1</span>/<span class="den">2</span><i>lbs.</i> of rice, 1<span class="hide">&nbsp;</span><span class="num">3</span>/<span class="den">4</span><i>lbs.</i> of vermicelli, or, it is
asserted, 8<i>lbs.</i> of raw potatoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;These preparations are found valuable to mix with wheaten flour for
bread, to make biscuits, pastry, pie-crusts, and for all soups, gruels,
and panada.</p>

<p>&#8220;Large engagements have been made for these preparations with the French
marine, and military and other hospitals, with the approbation of the
faculty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>&#8220;An excellent bread, it is said, can be made of this flour, at half the
cost of wheaten bread.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heat having been applied in these preparations, the articles will keep
unchanged for years, and on board ship, to China and back; rats, mice,
worms, and insects do not infect or destroy this flour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply mixed with cold water, they are in ten minutes fit for food,
when fire and all other resource may be wanted; and twelve ounces are
sufficient for a day&#8217;s sustenance, in case of necessity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The physicians and surgeons in the hospitals, in cases of great
debility of the stomach, have employed these preparations with
advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;The point of this discovery is, the cheapness of preparation, and the
conversion of a surplus growth of potatoes into a keeping stock, in an
elegant, portable, and salubrious form.&#8221;</p>

perceived; they are the invisible spirit of good cookery: indeed, a cook

finished; <i>i. e.</i> &#8216;Kill &#8217;em quick,&#8217; says a great botanist; by this means
their flavour will be best preserved: there can be no doubt of the
propriety of drying herbs, &amp;c. hastily by the aid of artificial heat,
rather than by the heat of the sun. In the application of artificial
heat, the only caution requisite is to avoid burning; and of this a
sufficient test is afforded by the preservation of the colour.&#8221; The
common custom is, when they are perfectly dried to put them in bags, and
lay them in a dry place; but the best way to preserve the flavour of
aromatic plants is to pick off the leaves as soon as they are dried, and
to pound them, and put them through a hair-sieve, and keep them in
well-stopped bottles.<a name="FNanchor_291-2_211" id="FNanchor_291-2_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_291-2_211" class="fnanchor">291-&#8224;</a> See <a href="#no_459">No. 459</a>.</p>

<p>Cut a crust of bread off a stale loaf, about twice the thickness toast
is usually cut: toast it carefully until it be completely browned all
over, but not at all blackened or burnt; pour as much boiling water as
you wish to make into drink, into the jug; put the toast into it, and
let it stand till it is quite cold: the fresher it is the better.</p>

currant-jelly (<a href="#no_recipe">No. 475*</a>), apples sliced or roasted, &amp;c. infused with the
bread, are grateful additions. N.B. If the boiling water be poured on
the bread it will break it, and make the drink grouty.</p>

<p><a name="nb-463" id="nb-463"></a>N.B. This is a refreshing summer drink; and when the proportion of the
fluids is destroyed by profuse perspiration, may be drunk plentifully.
Let a large jug be made early in the day, it will then become warmed by
the heat of the air, and may be drunk without danger; which water, cold
as it comes from the well, cannot in hot weather. <i>Or</i>,</p>

<p>To make it more expeditiously, put the bread into a <a name="corr66" id="corr66"></a>mug, and just cover
it with boiling water; let it stand till cold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span> then fill it up with

<p>Be careful to use clean and dried bottles; leave them unstopped for
twelve hours, and then cork them as closely as possible with good and
sound new corks; put a bit of lump sugar as big as a nutmeg into each
bottle: the beer will be ripe, <i>i. e.</i> fine and sparkling, in about four
or five weeks: if the weather is cold, to put it up the day before it is
drunk, place it in a room where there is a fire.</p>

<p>Remember there is a sediment, &amp;c. at the bottom of the bottles, which
you must carefully avoid disturbing; so pour it off at once, leaving a
wine-glassful at the bottom.</p>

<p><sup class="astsup">*</sup><sub class="astsub">*</sub><sup class="astsup">*</sup> If beer becomes hard or stale, a few grains of carbonate of potash

powdered loaf sugar to each quart of juice; stir it well together, and
cover it down; let it stand for three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span> days, stirring it up each day;

<p>Next to teaching how to make good things at home, is the information
where those things may be procured ready made of the best quality.</p>

<p>It is in vain to attempt to imitate the best foreign liqueurs, unless we
can obtain the pure vinous spirit with which they are made.</p>

<p>Johnson and Co., foreign liqueur and brandy merchants to his majesty and

seventy-one varieties of foreign liqueurs, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cura&ccedil;oa.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_474" id="no_474"></a>No. 474.)</h3>

<p>Put five ounces of thin-cut Seville orange-peel, that has been dried and
pounded, or, which is still better, of the fresh peel of a fresh
shaddock, which may be bought at the orange and lemon shops in the
beginning of March, into a quart of the finest and cleanest rectified
spirit; after it has been infused a fortnight, strain it, and add a
quart of syrup (<a href="#no_475">No. 475</a>), and filter. See the following receipt:</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>To make a Quart of Cura&ccedil;oa.</i></h3>

<p>To a pint of the cleanest and strongest rectified spirit, add two
drachms and a half of the sweet oil of orange-peel; shake it up:
dissolve a pound of good lump sugar in a pint of cold water; make this
into a clarified syrup (<a href="#no_475">No. 475</a>): which add to the spirit: shake it up,
and let it stand till the following day: then line a funnel with a piece
of muslin, and that with filtering-paper, and filter it two or three
times till it is quite bright. This liqueur is an admirable cordial; and
a tea-spoonful in a tumbler of water is a very refreshing summer drink,
and a great improvement to punch.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Clarified Syrup.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_475" id="no_475"></a>No. 475.)</h3>

<p>Break into bits two pounds (avoirdupois) of double refined lump sugar,
and put it into a clean stew-pan (that is well tinned), with a pint of
cold spring-water; when the sugar is dissolved, set it over a moderate
fire: beat about half the white of an egg, put it to the sugar before it
gets warm, and stir it well together. Watch it; and when it boils take
off the scum; keep it boiling till no scum rises, and it is perfectly
clear; then run it through a clean napkin: put it into a close stopped
bottle; it will keep for months, and is an elegant article on the
sideboard for sweetening.</p>

<p><a name="obs-475" id="obs-475"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;The proportion of sugar ordered in the above syrup is a quarter
pound more than that directed in the Pharmacop&oelig;ia of the London
College of Physicians. The quantity of sugar must be as much as the
liquor is capable of keeping dissolved when cold, or it will ferment,
and quickly spoil: if kept in a temperate degree of heat, the above
proportion of sugar may be considered the basis of all syrups.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Capillaire.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_476" id="no_476"></a>No. 476.)</h3>

<p>To a pint of clarified syrup add a wine-glass of Cura&ccedil;oa (<a href="#no_474">No. 474</a>); or
dissolve a drachm of oil of Neroli in two ounces of rectified spirit,
and add a few drops of it to clarified syrup.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Lemonade in a Minute.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_477" id="no_477"></a>No. 477.)</h3>

<p>Pound a quarter of an ounce (avoirdupois) of citric, <i>i. e.</i>

lemon-peel (<a href="#no_408">No. 408</a>), and mix it by degrees with a pint of clarified
syrup (<a href="#no_475">No. 475</a>), or capillaire.</p>

<p>For superlative syrup of lemons, see <a href="#no_391">No. 391</a>.</p>

<p><a name="obs-477" id="obs-477"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;The proportion of acid to the syrup, was that selected (from
several specimens) by the committee of taste. We advise those who are

<p>If you have none of <a href="#no_408">No. 408</a>, flavour your syrup with thin-cut
lemon-peel, or use syrup of lemon-peel (<a href="#no_393">No. 393</a>).</p>

<p>Are all made precisely in the same manner. When the fruit is full ripe,
gather it on a dry day: as soon as it is nicely picked, put it into a
jar, and cover it down very close.</p>

<p>Set the jar in a saucepan about three parts filled with cold water; put
it on a gentle fire, and let it simmer for about half an hour. Take the
pan from the fire, and pour the contents of the jar into a jelly-bag:
pass the juice through a second time; do not squeeze the bag.</p>

<p>To each pint of juice add a pound and a half of very good lump sugar
pounded; when it is dissolved, put it into a preserving-pan; set it on
the fire, and boil gently; stirring and skimming it the whole time
(about thirty or forty minutes), <i>i. e.</i> till no more scum rises, and it
is perfectly clear and fine: pour it while warm into pots; and when
cold, cover them with paper wetted in brandy.</p>

<p>Half a pint of this jelly, dissolved in a pint of brandy or vinegar,
will give you excellent currant or raspberry brandy or vinegar. To make
sweet sauce, see <a href="#no_346">No. 346</a>.</p>

<p><a name="obs-479-1" id="obs-479-1"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Jellies from other fruits are made in the same way, and cannot
be preserved in perfection without plenty of good sugar.</p>

<p>Those who wish jelly to turn out very stiff, dissolve isinglass in a
little water, strain through a sieve, and add it in the proportion of
half an ounce to a pint of juice, and put it in with the sugar.</p>

<p>The best way is the cheapest. Jellies made with too small a proportion
of sugar, require boiling so long; there is much more waste of juice and
flavour by evaporation than the due quantity of sugar costs; and they
neither look nor taste half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span> so delicate, as when made with a proper

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Calves&#8217;-Feet Jelly.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_481" id="no_481"></a>No. 481.)</h3>

<p>Take four calves&#8217; feet (not those which are sold at tripe-shops, which
have been boiled till almost all the gelatine is extracted; but buy them
at the butcher&#8217;s), slit them in two, take away the fat from between the
claws, wash them well in lukewarm water; then put them in a large
stew-pan, and cover them with water: when the liquor boils, skim it
well, and let it boil gently six or seven hours, that it may be reduced
to about two quarts; then strain it through a sieve, and skim off all
the oily substance which is on the surface of the liquor.</p>

<p>If you are not in a hurry, it is better to boil the calves&#8217; feet the day
before you make the jelly; as when the liquor is cold, the oily part
being at the top, and the other being firm, with pieces of kitchen paper
applied to it, you may remove every particle of the oily substance,
without wasting any of the liquor.</p>

<p>Put the liquor in a stew-pan to melt, with a pound of lump sugar, the
peel of two lemons, the juice of six, six whites and shells of eggs beat
together, and a bottle of sherry or Madeira; whisk the whole together
until it is on the boil; then put it by the side of the stove, and let
it simmer a quarter of an hour; strain it through a jelly-bag: what is
strained first must be poured into the bag again, until it is as bright
and as clear as rock-water; then put the jelly in moulds, to be cold and
firm: if the weather is too warm, it requires some ice.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Receipts for economical</i> Made Dishes,<i> written for the</i> Cook&#8217;s Oracle,
<i>by an accomplished</i> English Lady.&mdash;(<a name="no_483" id="no_483"></a>No. 483.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> experiments have arisen from my aversion to cold meat, and my
preference for what are termed French dishes; with which, by a certain
management, I think I can furnish my table at far less expense than is
generally incurred in getting up a plain dinner.</p>

<p>Gravy or soup meats I never buy; and yet am seldom without a good
provision of what is technically denominated stock.</p>

<p>When, as it frequently happens, we have ham dressed; if the joint be
above the weight of seven pounds, I have it cut in half, and prepared in
the following manner: first, ensure that it has been properly soaked,
scraped, and cleaned to a nicety; then put it into an earthen vessel, as
near its own size as possible, with just as much water as will cover it;
to which add four onions, a clove of garlic, half a dozen eschalots, a
bay-leaf, a bunch of sweet herbs, half a dozen cloves, a few peppercorns
and allspice: this should be well closed, and kept simmering about three
hours. It is then served with raspings or with glazing, the rind having
first been taken off neatly. The liquor is strained, and kept till
poultry of any sort, or meat, is boiled; when the liquor in which they
have been dressed should be added to it, and boiled down fast till
reduced to about three pints; when cold, it will be a highly flavoured,
well-coloured jelly,<a name="FNanchor_300-1_217" id="FNanchor_300-1_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_300-1_217" class="fnanchor">300-*</a> and ready for sauce for all kinds of rago&ucirc;ts
and hashes, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>A fillet of veal I divide into three parts; the meat before it is
skewered, will of itself indicate where the partition is natural, and
will pull asunder as you would quarter an orange; the largest piece
should be stuffed with <a href="#no_374">No. 374</a> or <a href="#no_375">No. 375</a>, and rolled up, compactly
skewered, &amp;c., and makes a very pretty small fillet: the square flat
piece will either cut into cutlets (<a href="#no_90">No. 90</a>, or <a href="#no_521">No. 521</a>), or slice for a
pie; and the thick piece must be well larded and dressed as a
fricandeau; which I do in the following-manner: put the larded veal into
a stew-pan just big enough to contain it, with as much water as will
cover it; when it has simmered till deli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>cately white, and so tender as
to be cut with a spoon, it must be taken out of the water and set apart;
and it will be ready to serve up either with sorrel, tomata, mushrooms
(<a href="#no_305">No. 305</a>, or <a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), or some of the above-mentioned stock, the
fricandeau being previously coloured with glazing; if with mushrooms,
they should be first parboiled in salt and vinegar, and water, which
gives them flavour, and keeps them of a good colour.</p>

<p>The sirloin of beef I likewise divide into three parts; I first have it
nicely boned.</p>

<p>The under part, or fillet, as the French call it, will dress (when cut
into slices) excellently, either as plain steaks (<a href="#no_94">No. 94</a>), curry (<a href="#no_recipe">No.
197</a>), or it may be larded whole, and gently stewed in two quarts of
water (a bay-leaf, two onions, their skins roasted brown, four cloves,
allspice, &amp;c. &amp;c.) till tender, when it should be taken out, drained
quite dry, and put away; it is then ready to be used at any time in the
following manner: season and dredge it well, then put it into a stewpan
in which a piece of butter has been previously fried to a fine froth;
when the meat is sufficiently brown, take it out, and throw into the pan
half a dozen middle-sized onions, to do a fine gold colour; that
accomplished, (during which the dredger should be in constant use,) add
half a pint of stock, and a tea-spoonful of tarragon vinegar (<a href="#no_396">No. 396</a>),
and let the onions stew gently till nearly tender: the beef should then
be returned to the stew-pan, and the whole suffered to simmer till the
meat is warm through: care must be taken that the onions do not break,
and they should be served round the beef with as much sauce as will look
graceful in the dish. The fillet is likewise very good without the fried
onions; in that case you should chop and mix up together an eschalot,
some parsley, a few capers, and the yelk of a hard egg, and strew them
lightly over the surface of the beef.</p>

<p>The fat end of the sirloin and bones should be put to simmer in the
liquor in which the fillet was first stewed, and done till the beef
looks loose; it should then be put away into a deep vessel, and the soup
strained over it, which cooling with the fat upon the top (thereby
excluding the air), will keep as long as may be required: when the soup
is to be used, the fat must be cleared from it; a carrot, parsnip, a
head of celery, a leek, and three turnips, cleaned and scalded, should
be added to it, and the whole suffered to simmer gently till the
vegetables are quite done, when they must be strained from the liquor,
and the soup served up with large square thick pieces of toasted bread.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>Those who like a plain bouilli warm the beef in the soup, and serve it
up with the turnips and carrots which had been strained before from the
soup. A white cabbage quartered is no bad addition to the garnish of the
bouilli, or to the flavour of the soup. If it is a dressed bouilli,
sliced carrots and button onions should be stewed in thickened stock,
and poured over the meat.</p>

<p>A neck of mutton boned, sprinkled with dried sage, powdered fine, or
(<a href="#no_378">No. 378</a>) seasoned, rolled, and roasted, is very good. The bones and
scrag make excellent gravy stewed down, and if done very gently, the
meat is not bad eating. The same herbs should be put to it as to other
stocks, with the addition of a carrot; this will make very good mutton
broth. In short, wherever there are bones or trimmings to be got out of
any meat that is dressed in my kitchen, they are made to contribute
towards soup or gravy, or <a href="#no_252">No. 252</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of roasting a hare, (which at best is but dry food), stew it, if
young, plain; if an old one, lard it. The shoulders and legs should be
taken off, and the back cut into three pieces; these, with a bay-leaf,
half a dozen eschalots, one onion pierced with four cloves, should be
laid with as much good vinegar as will cover them, for twenty-four
hours, in a deep dish. In the mean time, the head, neck, ribs, liver,
heart, &amp;c. &amp;c. should be browned in frothed butter well seasoned; add
half a pound of lean bacon, cut into small pieces, a large bunch of
herbs, a carrot, and a few allspice; simmer these in a quart of water
till it be reduced to about half the quantity, when it should be
strained, and those parts of the hare which have been infused in the
vinegar, should (with the whole contents of the dish) be added to it,
and stewed till quite done. Those who like onions may brown half a
dozen, stew them in a part of the gravy, and dish them round the hare.</p>

<p>When it comes from the table, supposing some to be left, the meat should
be taken from the bones, and with a few forcemeat balls, the remains of
the gravy, about a quarter of a pint of red wine, and a proportionable
quantity of water, it will make a very pretty soup; to those who have no
objection to catchup (<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>,) a spoonful in the original gravy is an
improvement, as indeed it is in every made dish, where the mushroom
itself is not at command.</p>

<p>Every rago&ucirc;t, in my opinion, should be dressed the day before it is
wanted, that any fat which has escaped the skimming spoon, may with ease
be taken off when cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calf&#8217;s head.</span>&mdash;Take the half of one, with the skin on; put it into a
large stew-pan, with, as much water as will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span> cover it, a knuckle of ham,
and the usual accompaniments of onions, herbs, &amp;c. &amp;c., and let it
simmer till the flesh may be separated from the bone with a spoon; do
so, and while still hot, cut it into as large a sized square as the
piece will admit of; the trimmings and half the liquor put by in a
tureen; to the remaining half add a gill of white wine, and reduce the
whole of that by quick boiling till it is again half consumed, when it
should be poured over the large square piece in an earthen vessel,
surrounded with mushrooms, white button onions, small pieces of pickled
pork, half an inch in breadth, and one and a half in length, and the
tongue in slices, and simmered till the whole is fit to serve up; some
browned forcemeat balls are a pretty addition. After this comes from the
table, the remains should be cut into small pieces, and mixed up with
the trimmings and liquor, which (with a little more wine), properly
thickened, will make a very good mock turtle soup for a future occasion.</p>

<p>The inside of a sirloin of beef is best for this dish, or a leg of
mutton. Cut the slices of even and equal thickness, and broil and brown
them carefully and slightly over a clear smart fire, or in a Dutch oven;
give those slices most fire that are least done; lay them in a dish

<p>Take five thick mutton chops, or two pounds off the neck or loin; two
pounds of potatoes; peel them, and cut them in halves; six onions, or
half a pound of onions; peel and slice them also: first put a layer of
potatoes at the bottom of your stew-pan, then a couple of chops and some
of the onions; then again potatoes, and so on, till the pan is quite
full; a small spoonful of white pepper, and about one and a half of
salt, and three gills of broth or gravy, and two tea-spoonfuls of
mushroom catchup; cover all very close in, so as to prevent the steam
from getting out, and let them stew for an hour and a half on a very
slow fire. A small slice of ham is a great addition to this dish. The
cook will be the best judge when it is done, as a great deal depends on
the fire you have.</p>

<p><a name="nb-488" id="nb-488"></a>N.B. Great care must be taken not to let it burn, and that it does not
do too fast.</p>

<p>Make the haggis-bag perfectly clean; parboil the draught; boil the liver
very well, so as it will grate; dry the meal before the fire; mince the
draught and a pretty large piece of beef very small; grate about half of
the liver; mince plenty of the suet and some onions small; mix all these
materials very well together, with a handful or two of the dried meal;
spread them on the table, and season them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> properly with salt and mixed
spices; take any of the scraps of beef that are left from mincing, and
some of the water that boiled the draught, and make about a choppin (<i>i.
e.</i> a quart) of good stock of it; then put all the haggis meat into the
bag, and that broth in it; then sew up the bag; but be sure to put out
all the wind before you sew it quite close. If you think the bag is
thin, you may put it in a cloth. If it is a large haggis, it will take
at least two hours boiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a favourite Scotch dish; few families are without it: it keeps
well, and is always ready to make an extra dish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take beef, and chop and mince it very small; to which add some salt and
pepper. Put this, in its raw state, into small jars, and pour on the top
some clarified butter. When intended for use, put the clarified butter
into a frying-pan, and slice some onions into the pan, and fry them. Add
a little water to it, and then put in the minced meat. Stew it well, and
in a few minutes it will be fit to serve up.&#8221;&mdash;The Hon. <span class="smcap">John Cochrane&#8217;s</span>

<p>Cut the best end of a neck or loin of mutton, that has been kept till
tender, into chops of equal thickness, one rib to each (&#8220;<i>les bons
hommes de bouche de Paris</i>&#8221; cut two chops to one bone, but it is more
convenient to help when there is only one; two at a time is too large a
dose for John Bull), trim off some of the fat, and the lower end of the
chine bone, and scrape it clean, and lay them in a stew-pan, with an
ounce of butter; set it over a smart fire; if your fire is not sharp,
the chops will be done before they are coloured: the intention of frying
them is merely to give them a very light browning.</p>

<p>While the chops are browning, peel and boil a couple of dozen of young
button onions in about three pints of water for about fifteen or twenty
minutes, set them by, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span> pour off the liquor they were boiled in into
the stew-pan with the chops: if that is not sufficient to cover them,
add as much boiling water as will; remove the scum as it rises, and be
careful they are not stewed too fast or too much; so take out one of
them with a fish-slice, and try it: when they are tender, which will be
in about an hour and a half, then pass the gravy through a sieve into a
basin, set it in the open air that it may get cold, you may then easily
and completely skim off the fat; in the mean time set the meat and
vegetables by the fire to keep hot, and pour some boiling water over the
button onions to warm them. Have about six ounces of carrots, and eight
ounces of turnips, peeled and cut into slices, or shaped into balls
about as big as a nutmeg; boil the carrots about half an hour, the
turnips about a quarter of an hour, and put them on a sieve to drain,
and then put them round the dish, the last thing.</p>

<p>Thicken the gravy by putting an ounce of butter into a stew-pan; when it
is melted, stir in as much flour as will stiffen it; pour the gravy to
it by degrees, stir together till it boils; strain it through a fine
sieve or tamis into a stew-pan, put in the carrots and turnips to get
warm, and let it simmer gently while you dish up the meat; lay the chops
round a dish; put the vegetables in the middle, and pour the thickened
gravy over. Some put in capers, &amp;c. minced gherkins, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Put the chops into a stew-pan with cold water enough to cover them, and
an onion: when it is coming to a boil, skim it, cover the pan close, and
set it over a very slow fire till the chops are tender: if they have
been kept a proper time, they will take about three quarters of an
hour&#8217;s very gentle simmering. Send up turnips with them (<a href="#no_130">No. 130</a>); they

<p>Desire the butcher to saw the bone into three or four pieces, put it
into a stew-pan, and just cover it with cold water; when it simmers,
skim it clean; then put in a bundle of sweet herbs, a large onion, a
head of celery, a dozen berries of black pepper, and the same of
allspice: stew very gently over a slow fire till the meat is tender;
this will take from about three hours and a half, to four and a half.</p>

<p>Take three carrots, peel and cut them into small squares; peel and cut
ready in small squares a couple of turnips, with a couple of dozen of
small young round silver button onions; boil them, till tender; the
turnips and onions will be enough in about fifteen minutes; the carrots
will require about twice as long: drain them dry.</p>

<p>When the beef is quite tender, take it out carefully with a slice, and

this, mix three table-spoonfuls of flour with a tea-cupful of the beef
liquor; to make soup of the rest of it, see <a href="#no_238">No. 238</a>; stir this
thoroughly together till it boils, skim off the fat, strain it through a

a wine-glass of mushroom catchup (<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), or port wine, or both, and

handsome pieces fit to help at table, and lay it in the middle of the

precisely the same: there is this only difference, the former is

<p>A stewed brisket cut in slices, and sent up with the same sauce of

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Savoury Salt Beef baked.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_496" id="no_496"></a>No. 496.)</h3>

<p>The tongue side of a round of beef is the best bit for this purpose: if
it weighs fifteen pounds, let it hang two or three days; then take three
ounces of saltpetre, one ounce of coarse sugar, a quarter of an ounce
of black pepper, and the same of allspice (some add a quarter of an
ounce of ginger, or <a href="#no_457">No. 457</a>), and some minced sweet and savoury herbs
(<a href="#no_459">No. 459</a>), and three quarters of a pound of common salt; incorporate
these ingredients by pounding them together in a mortar; then take the
bone out, and rub the meat well with the above mixture, turning it and
rubbing it every day for a fortnight.</p>

<p>When you dress it, put it into a pan with a quart of water; cover the
meat with about three pounds of mutton suet<a name="FNanchor_310-1_225" id="FNanchor_310-1_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_310-1_225" class="fnanchor">310-*</a> shredded rather
thick, and an onion or two minced small; cover the whole with a flour
crust to the top or brim of the pan, and let it be baked in a
moderate-heated oven for about six hours: (or, just cover it with water,
and let it stew very gently for about five hours, and when you send it
to table, cover the top of it with finely chopped parsley.) If the beef
weighs more, put a proportional addition of all the ingredients.</p>

<p>The gravy you will find a strong <i>consomm&eacute;</i>, excellent for sauce or
soup; or making soy, or browning, see <a href="#no_322">No. 322</a>, and being impregnated
with salt, will keep several days.</p>

<p>This joint should not be cut till it is cold: and then, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span> sharp

<p>Cut fowls or rabbits into joints, and wash them clean: put two ounces of
butter into a stew-pan; when it is melted, put in the meat, and two
middling-sized onions sliced, let them be over a smart fire till they
are of a light brown, then put in half a pint of broth; let it simmer
twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Put in a basin one or two table-spoonfuls of curry powder (<a href="#no_455">No. 455</a>), a
tea-spoonful of flour, and a tea-spoonful of salt; mix it smooth with a
little cold water, put it into the stew-pan, and shake it well about
till it boils: let it simmer twenty minutes longer; then take out the
meat, and rub the sauce through a tamis or sieve: add to it two table
spoonfuls of cream or milk; give it a boil up; then pour it into a dish,
lay the meat over it: send up the rice in a separate dish.</p>

<p>The steaks must be a little thicker than for broiling: let them be all
the same thickness, or some will be done too little, and others too
much.</p>

<p>Put an ounce of butter into a stew-pan, with two onions; when the butter
is melted, lay in the rump-steaks, let them stand over a slow fire for
five minutes, then turn them and let the other side of them fry for five
minutes longer. Have ready boiled a pint of button onions; they will
take from half an hour to an hour; put the liquor they were boiled in to
the steaks; if there is not enough of it to cover them, add broth or
boiling water, to make up enough for that purpose, with a dozen corns of
black pepper, and a little salt, and let them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span> simmer very gently for
about an hour and a half, and then strain off as much of the liquor
(about a pint and a half) as you think will make the sauce.</p>

<p>Put two ounces of butter into a stew-pan; when it is melted, stir in as
much flour as will make it into a stiff paste; some add thereto a
table-spoonful of claret, or Port wine, the same of mushroom catchup
(<a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>), half a tea-spoonful of salt, and a quarter of a tea-spoonful
of ground black pepper: add the liquor by degrees; let it boil up for
fifteen minutes; skim it, and strain it; serve up the steaks with the
onions round the dish, and pour the gravy over.</p>

<p>Veal-cutlets or mutton-chops may be done the same way, or as veal-olives
(<a href="#no_518">No. 518</a>).</p>

<p>This is generally a second-course dish, and is usually made too rich,
and only fit to re-excite an appetite already satiated. Our endeavour is
to combine agreeable savouriness with substantial nourishment; those who
wish to enrich our receipt, may easily add mushrooms, wine, anchovy,
Cayenne, bay-leaves, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Peel and slice two large onions, put them into a quart stew-pan, with
two table-spoonfuls of water; cover the stew-pan close, and set it on a
slow fire till the water has boiled away, and the onions have got a

onions till they are tender; strain the broth from them, and chop them
very fine, and season it with mushroom catchup, pepper, and salt: put
the onion into it, and let it boil gently for five minutes; pour it into
the dish, and lay over it a broiled rump-steak. If instead of broth you
use good beef gravy, it will be superlative.</p>

we encountered the tremendous labour and expense of proving the receipts
of our predecessors, and set about recording these results of our own
experiments, we could not find one receipt that approximated to any
thing like an accurate description of the way in which this excellent
dish is actually dressed in the best alamode beef shops; from whence, of
course, it was impossible to obtain any information: however, after all,
the whole of the secret seems to be the thickening of the gravy of beef
that has been very slowly<a name="FNanchor_313-1_227" id="FNanchor_313-1_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_313-1_227" class="fnanchor">313-*</a> stewed, and flavouring it with
bay-leaves and allspice.</p>

<p>Take about eleven pounds of the mouse buttock, or clod of beef, or a
blade-bone, or the sticking-piece, or the like weight of the breast of
veal; cut it into pieces of three or four ounces each; put three or four
ounces of beef drippings, and mince a couple of large onions, and put
them into a large deep stew-pan; as soon as it is quite hot, flour the
meat, put it into the stew-pan, keep stirring it with a wooden spoon;
when it has been on about ten minutes, dredge it with flour, and keep
doing so till you have stirred in as much as you think will thicken it;
then cover it with boiling water (it will take about a gallon), adding
it by degrees, and stirring it together; skim it when it boils, and then
put in one drachm of ground black pepper, two of allspice, and two
bay-leaves; set the pan by the side of the fire, or at a distance over
it, and let it stew very slowly for about three hours; when you find the
meat sufficiently tender, put it into a tureen, and it is ready for
table.</p>

<p><sup class="astsup">*</sup><sub class="astsub">*</sub><sup class="astsup">*</sup> To the above many cooks add champignons; but as these are almost
always decayed, and often of deleterious quality, they are better left
out, and indeed the bay-leaves deserve the same prohibition.</p>

them coming into a house, and asking for all things necessary for the
making of one, was as soon told that he could have none of those things
there, whereupon he went away; the other, coming in with a stone in his
knapsack, asked only for a pot to boil his stone in, that he might make
a dish of broth of it for his supper, which was quickly granted him;
when the stone had boiled a little while, he asked for a small piece of
meat or bacon, and a few herbs and roots, &amp;c. just merely to give it a
bit of a flavour; till, by little and little, he got all things

<p>Take three pounds of lean gravy beef, rub it well with an ounce of
saltpetre, and then a handful of common salt; let it lie in salt for a
couple of days, rubbing it well each day; then put it into an earthen

sprinkled with a little pepper, and just lightly browned with a bit of

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Slices of Ham or Bacon.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_526" id="no_526"></a>No. 526.)</h3>

<p>Ham, or bacon, may be fried, or broiled on a gridiron over a clear fire,
or toasted with a fork: take care to slice it of the same thickness in
every part.</p>

<p>If you wish it curled, cut it in slices about two inches long (if
longer, the outside will be done too much before the inside is done
enough); roll it up, and put a little wooden skewer through it: put it
in a cheese-toaster, or Dutch oven, for eight or ten minutes, turning it
as it gets crisp.</p>

<p>This is considered the handsomest way of dressing bacon; but we like it
best uncurled, because it is crisper, and more equally done.</p>

<p><a name="obs-526" id="obs-526"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Slices of ham or bacon should not be more than half a quarter of
an inch thick, and will eat much more mellow if soaked in hot water for
a quarter of an hour, and then dried in a cloth before they are broiled,
&amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Relishing Rashers of Bacon.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_527" id="no_527"></a>No. 527.)</h3>

<p>If you have any cold bacon, you may make a very nice dish of it by
cutting it into slices about a quarter of an inch thick; grate some
crust of bread, as directed for ham (see <a href="#no_14">No. 14</a>), and powder them well
with it on both sides; lay the rashers in a cheese-toaster, they will be
browned on one side in about three minutes, turn them and do the other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;These are a delicious accompaniment to poached or fried Eggs:

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Hashed Venison.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_528" id="no_528"></a>No. 528.)</h3>

<p>If you have enough of its own gravy left, it is preferable to any to
warm it up in: if not, take some of the mutton gravy (<a href="#no_347">No. 347</a>), or the
bones and trimmings of the joint (after you have cut off all the
handsome slices you can to make the hash); put these into some water,
and stew them gently for an hour; then put some butter into a stew-pan;
when melted, put to it as much flour as will dry up the butter, and stir
it well together; add to it by degrees the gravy you have been making of
the trimmings, and some red currant jelly; give it a boil up; skim it;
strain it through a sieve, and it is ready to receive the venison: put
it in, and let it just get warm: if you let it boil, it will make the
meat hard.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Hashed Hare.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_529" id="no_529"></a>No. 529.)</h3>

<p>Cut up the hare into pieces fit to help at table, and divide the joints
of the legs and shoulders, and set them by ready.</p>

<p>Put the trimmings and gravy you have left, with half a pint of water
(there should be a pint of liquor), and a table-spoonful of currant
jelly, into a clean stew-pan, and let it boil gently for a quarter of an
hour: then strain it through a sieve into a basin, and pour it back into
the stew-pan; now flour the hare, put it into the gravy, and let it
simmer very gently till the hare is warm (about twenty minutes); cut the
stuffing into slices, and put it into the hash to get warm, about five
minutes before you serve it; divide the head, and lay one half on each
side the dish.</p>

<p>Wash it very nicely; cut it up into pieces proper to help at table, and
put them into a jugging-pot, or into a stone jar,<a name="FNanchor_325-2_239" id="FNanchor_325-2_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_325-2_239" class="fnanchor">325-&#8224;</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> just
sufficiently large to hold it well; put in some sweet herbs, a roll or
two of rind of a lemon, or a Seville orange, and a fine large onion with
five cloves stuck in it,&mdash;and if you wish to preserve the flavour of the
hare, a quarter of a pint of water; if you are for a <i>rago&ucirc;t</i>, a quarter
of a pint of claret, or port wine, and the juice of a Seville orange, or
lemon: tie the jar down closely with a bladder, so that no steam can
escape; put a little hay in the bottom of the saucepan, in which place
the jar, and pour in water till it reaches within four inches of the top
of the jar; let the water boil for about three hours, according to the
age and size of the hare (take care it is not over-done, which is the
general fault in all made dishes, especially this), keeping it boiling
all the time, and fill up the pot as it boils away. When quite tender,
strain off the gravy clear from fat; thicken it with flour, and give it
a boil up: lay the hare in a soup-dish, and pour the gravy to it.</p>

<p><a name="obs-529-1" id="obs-529-1"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;You may make a pudding the same as for roast hare (see <a href="#no_397">No. 397</a>),

when it boils, skim it clean, and let it simmer gently till tender
(about two hours); then take it up with a slice, and set it by the fire
to keep hot while you thicken the gravy; take three ounces of butter,
and some flour; rub together; put in the gravy; stir it well, and let it
boil about ten minutes; strain it through a sieve over the hare, and it
is ready.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Dressed Ducks, or Geese hashed.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_530" id="no_530"></a>No. 530.)</h3>

<p>Cut an onion into small dice; put it into a stew-pan with a bit of
butter; fry it, but do not let it get any colour; put as much boiling
water into the stew-pan as will make sauce for the hash; thicken it with
a little flour; cut up the duck, and put it into the sauce to warm; do
not let it boil; season it with pepper and salt, and catchup.</p>

gourmands</i> as well as &#8220;<i>v&eacute;ritable sauce d&#8217;Enfer</i>.&#8221;&mdash;Vide <i>School for the
Officers of the Mouth</i>, p. 368, 18mo. London, 1682.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Every man must have experienced, that when he has got deep into
his third bottle, his palate acquires a degree of torpidity, and
his stomach is seized with a certain craving, which seem to demand
a stimulant to the powers of both. The provocatives used on such
occasions, an ungrateful world has combined to term devils.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>diables au feu d&#8217;enfer</i>, or dry devils, are usually composed
of the broiled legs and gizzards of poultry, fish-bones, or
biscuits; and, if pungency alone can justify their appellation,
never was title better deserved, for they are usually prepared
without any other intention than to make them &#8216;hot as their native
element,&#8217; and any one who can swallow them without tears in his
eyes, need be under no<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 91%;"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> apprehension of the pains of futurity. It
is true, they answer the purpose of exciting thirst; but they
excoriate the palate, vitiate its nicer powers of discrimination,
and pall the relish for the high flavour of good wine: in short, no
man should venture upon them whose throat is not paved with mosaic,
unless they be seasoned by a cook who can poise the pepper-box with
as even a hand as a judge should the scales of justice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be an insult to the understanding of our readers, to
suppose them ignorant of the usual mode of treating common devils;
but we shall make no apology for giving the most minute
instructions for the preparation of a gentler stimulant, which,
besides, possesses this advantage&mdash;that it may be all done at the
table, either by yourself, or at least under your own immediate
inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mix equal parts of fine salt, Cayenne pepper, and curry powder,
with double the quantity of powder of truffles: dissect, <i>secundum
artem</i>, a brace of woodcocks rather under-roasted, split the heads,
subdivide the wings, &amp;c. &amp;c. and powder the whole gently over with
the mixture; crush the trail and brains along with the yelk of a
hard-boiled egg, a small portion of pounded mace, the grated peel
of half a lemon, and half a spoonful of soy, until the ingredients
be brought to the consistence of a fine paste: then add a
table-spoonful of catchup, a full wine-glass of Madeira, and the
juice of two Seville oranges: throw this sauce, along with the
birds, into a silver stew-dish, to be heated with spirits of wine:
cover close up, light the lamp, and keep gently simmering, and
occasionally stirring, until the flesh has imbibed the greater part
of the liquid. When you have reason to suppose it is completely
saturated, pour in a small quantity of salad oil, stir all once
more well together, &#8216;put out the light, and then!&#8217;&mdash;serve it round
instantly; for it is scarcely necessary to say, that a devil should
not only be hot in itself, but eaten hot.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is, however, one precaution to be used in eating it, to
which we most earnestly recommend the most particular attention;
and for want of which, more than one accident has occurred. It is
not, as some people might suppose, to avoid eating too much of it
(for that your neighbours will take good care to prevent); but it
is this: in order to pick the bones, you must necessarily take some
portion of it with your fingers; and, as they thereby become
impregnated with its flavour, if you afterward chance to let them
touch your tongue, you will infallibly lick them to the bone, if
you do not swallow them entire.&#8221;&mdash;See page 124, &amp;c. of the

quite hot, will be found a delicious dish and very wholesome. Or, boil
macaroni as directed in the receipt for the pudding, and serve it quite
hot in a deep tureen, and let each guest add grated parmesan and cold
butter, or oiled butter served hot, and it is excellent; this is the
most common Italian mode of dressing it. Macaroni with cream, sugar, and
cinnamon, or a little varicelli added to the cream, makes a very nice
sweet dish.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>English way of dressing Macaroni.</i></h3>

<p>Put a quarter of a pound of riband macaroni into a stew-pan, with a pint
of boiling milk, or broth, or water; let it boil gently till it is
tender, this will take about a quarter of an hour; then put in an ounce
of grated cheese, and a tea-spoonful of salt; mix it well together, and
put it on a dish, and stew over it two ounces of grated Parmesan or
Cheshire cheese, and give it a light brown in a Dutch oven. Or put all
the cheese into the macaroni, and put bread-crumbs over the top.</p>

<p>Macaroni is very good put into a thick sauce with some shreds of dressed
ham, or in a curry sauce. Riband macaroni is best for these dishes, and
should not be done so much.</p>

<p>One of the most excellent preparations of macaroni is the Timbale de
Macaroni. Simmer half a pound of macaroni in plenty of water, and a
table-spoonful of salt, till it is tender; but take care not to have it
too soft; though tender, it should be firm, and the form entirely
preserved, and no part beginning to melt (this caution will serve for
the preparation of all macaroni). Strain the water from it; beat up five
yelks and the white of two eggs; take half a pint of the best cream, and
the breast of a fowl, and some thin slices of ham. Mince the breast of
the fowl with the ham; add them with from two to three table-spoonfuls
of finely-grated parmesan cheese, and season with pepper and salt. Mix
all these with the macaroni, and put into a pudding-mould well buttered,
and then let it steam in a stew-pan of boiling water for about an hour,
and serve quite hot, with rich gravy (as in Omelette). See <a href="#no_543-1">No. 543*</a>.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Omelettes and various ways of dressing Eggs.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_543-1" id="no_543-1"></a>No. 543*.)</h3>

<p>There is no dish which in this country may be considered as coming under
the denomination of a made dish of the second order, which is so
generally eaten, if good, as an omelette; and no one is so often badly
dressed: it is a very faithful assistant in the construction of a
dinner.</p>

<p>When you are taken by surprise, and wish to make an appearance beyond
what is provided for the every-day dinner, a little portable soup melted
down, and some zest (<a href="#no_recipe">No. 255</a>), and a few vegetables, will make a good
broth; a pot of the stewed veal of Morrison&#8217;s, warmed up; an omelette;
and some apple or lemon fritters, can all be got ready at ten minutes&#8217;
notice, and with the original foundation of a leg of mutton, or a piece
of beef, will make up a very good dinner when company unexpectedly
arrives, in the country.</p>

<p>The great merit of an omelette is, that it should not be greasy, burnt,
nor too much done: if too much of the white of the eggs is left in, no
art can prevent its being hard, if it is done: to dress the omelette,
the fire should not be too hot, as it is an object to have the whole
substance heated, without much browning the outside.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>One of the great errors in cooking an omelette is, that it is too thin;
consequently, instead of feeling full and moist in the mouth, the
substance presented is little better than a piece of fried leather: to
get the omelette thick is one of the great objects. With respect to the
flavours to be introduced, these are infinite; that which is most
common, however, is the best, viz. finely chopped parsley, and chives or
onions, or eschalots: however, one made of a mixture of tarragon,
chervil, and parsley, is a very delicate variety, omitting or adding the
onion or chives. Of the meat flavours, the veal kidney is the most
delicate, and is the most admired by our neighbours the French: this
should be cut in dice, and should be dressed (boiled) before it is
added; in the same manner, ham and anchovies, shred small, or tongue,
will make a very delicately flavoured dish.</p>

<p>The objection to an omelette is, that it is too rich, which makes it
advisable to eat but a small quantity. An addition of some finely mashed
potatoes, about two table-spoonfuls, to an omelette of six eggs, will
much lighten it.</p>

<p>Omelettes are often served with rich gravy; but, as a general principle,
no substance which has been fried should be served in gravy, but
accompanied by <a name="corr80" id="corr80"></a>it, or what ought to eat dry and crisp, becomes soddened
and flat.</p>

<p>In the compounding the gravy, great care should be taken that the
flavour does not overcome that of the omelette, a thing too little
attended to: a fine gravy, with a flavouring of sweet herbs and onions,
we think the best; some add a few drops of tarragon vinegar; but this is
to be done only with great care: gravies to Omelettes are in general
thickened: this should never be done with flour; potato starch, or arrow
root, is the best.</p>

<p>Omelettes should be fried in a small frying-pan made for that purpose,
with a small quantity of butter. The omelette&#8217;s great merit is to be
thick, so as not to taste of the outside; therefore use only half the
number of whites that you do yelks of eggs: every care must be taken in
frying, even at the risk of not having it quite set in the middle: an
omelette, which has so much vogue abroad, is here, in general, a thin
doubled-up piece of leather, and harder than soft leather sometimes. The
fact is, that as much care must be bestowed on the frying, as should be
taken in poaching an egg. A salamander is necessary to those who will
have the top brown; but the kitchen shovel may be substituted for it.</p>

<p>The following receipt is the basis of all omelettes, of which you may
make an endless variety, by taking, instead of the parsley and eschalot,
a portion of sweet herbs, or any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span> of the articles enumerated in the
table of materials used for making forcemeats, see <a href="#no_373">No. 373</a>; or any of
the forcemeats between Nos. <a href="#no_373">373</a> and <a href="#no_386">386</a>.</p>

<p>Omelettes are called by the name of what is added to flavour them: a ham
or tongue omelette; an anchovy, or veal kidney omelette, &amp;c.: these are
prepared exactly in the same way as in the first receipt, leaving out
the parsley and eschalot, and mincing the ham or kidney very fine, &amp;c.,
and adding that in the place of them, and then pour over them all sorts
of thickened gravies, sauces, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Receipt for the common Omelette.</i></h3>

<p>Five or six eggs will make a good-sized omelette; break them into a
basin, and beat them well with a fork; and add a salt-spoonful of salt;
have ready chopped two drachms of onion, or three drachms of parsley, a
good clove of eschalot minced very fine; beat it well up with the eggs;
then take four ounces of fresh butter, and break half of it into little
bits, and put it into the omelette, and the other half into a very clean
frying-pan; when it is melted, pour in the omelette, and stir it with a
spoon till it begins to set, then turn it up all round the edges, and
when it is of a nice brown it is done: the safest way to take it out is
to put a plate on the omelette, and turn the pan upside-down: serve it
on a hot dish; it should never be done till just wanted. If maigre,
grated cheese, shrimps, or oysters. If oysters, boil them four minutes,
and take away the beard and gristly part; they may either be put in
whole, or cut in bits. <i>Or</i>,</p>

<p>Take eggs ready boiled hard, and either fry them whole, or cut them in
half; when they are boiled (they will take five minutes), let them lie
in cold water till you want to use them; then roll them lightly with
your hand on a table, and they will peel without breaking; put them on a
cloth to dry, and dredge them lightly with flour; beat two eggs in a
basin, dip the eggs in, one at a time, and then roll them in fine
bread-crumbs, or in duck (<a href="#no_378">No. 378</a>) or veal stuffing (<a href="#no_374">No. 374</a>); set them
away ready for frying; fry them in hot oil or clarified butter, serve
them up with mushroom sauce, or any other thickened sauce you please;
crisp parsley is a pretty garnish. <i>Or</i>,</p>

<p>Do not boil the eggs till wanted; boil them ten minutes, peel them as
above, cut them in half, put them on a dish, and have ready a sauce made
of two ounces of butter and flour well rubbed together on a plate, and
put it in a stew-pan with three quarters of a pint of good milk; set it
on the fire, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> stir it till it boils; if it is not quite smooth,
strain it through a sieve, chop some parsley and a clove of eschalot as
fine as possible, and put in your sauce: season it with salt to your
taste: a little mace and lemon-peel boiled with the sauce, will improve
it: if you like it still richer, you may add a little cream, or the
yelks of two eggs, beat up with two table-spoonfuls of milk, and stir it
in the last thing: do not let it boil after; place the half eggs on a
dish with the yelks upward, and pour the sauce over them.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-335" id="nb-p-335"></a>N.B. Any cold fish cut in pieces may be warmed in the above sauce for a
sent dinner. <i>Or</i>,</p>

<p>Slice very thin two onions weighing about two ounces each; put them into
a stew-pan with three ounces of butter; keep them covered till they are
just done; stir them every now and then, and when they are of a nice
brown, stir in as much flour as will make them of a stiff paste; then by
degrees add as much water or milk as will make it the thickness of good
cream; season it with, pepper and salt to your taste; have ready boiled
hard four or five eggs&mdash;you may either shred them, or cut them in halves
or quarters; then put them in the sauce: when they are hot they are
ready: garnish them with sippets of bread.</p>

<p>Or, have ready a plain omelette, cut into bits, and put them into the
sauce.</p>

<p>Or, cut off a little bit of one end of the eggs, so that they may stand
up; and take out the yelks whole of some of them, and cut the whites in
half, or in quarters.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Eggs fried with Bacon.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_545" id="no_545"></a>No. 545.)</h3>

<p>Lay some slices of fine streaked bacon (not more than a quarter of an
inch thick) in a clean dish, and toast them before the fire in a
cheese-toaster, turning them when the upper side is browned; first ask
those who are to eat the bacon, if they wish it much or little done, <i>i.
e.</i> curled and crisped, see <a href="#no_526">No. 526</a>, or mellow and soft (<a href="#no_527">No. 527</a>): if
the latter, parboil it first.</p>

best fats for frying eggs.</p>

<p>Be sure the frying-pan is quite clean; when the fat is hot, break two or
three eggs into it; do not turn them, but, while they are frying, keep
pouring some of the fat over them with a spoon; when the yelk just
begins to look white, which it will in about a couple of minutes, they
are done enough; the white must not lose its transparency, but the yelk
be seen blushing through it: if they are done nicely, they will look as
white and delicate as if they had been poached; take them up with a tin
slice, drain the fat from them, trim them neatly, and send them up with
the bacon round them.</p>

little chopped parsley, an anchovy, an eschalot, a quarter of an ounce
of butter, a table-spoonful of mushroom catchup, a little Cayenne, some
bread-crumbs, and a very little beaten mace, or allspice; incorporate
them well together, and fill the halves of the whites with this mixture;
do them over with the yelk of an egg, and brown them in a Dutch oven,
and serve them on relishing rashers of bacon or ham, see <a href="#no_527">No. 527</a>.</p>

<p>The cook who wishes to display her skill in poaching, must endeavour to
procure eggs that have been laid a couple of days&mdash;those that are quite
new-laid are so milky that, take all the care you can, your cooking of
them will seldom procure you the praise of being a prime poacher; you
must have fresh eggs, or it is equally impossible.</p>

<p>The beauty of a poached egg is for the yelk to be seen blushing through
the white, which should only be just sufficiently hardened, to form a
transparent veil for the egg.</p>

<p>Have some boiling water<a name="FNanchor_337-1_242" id="FNanchor_337-1_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_337-1_242" class="fnanchor">337-*</a> in a tea-kettle; pass as much of it
through a clean cloth as will half fill a stew-pan; break the egg into a
cup, and when the water boils, remove the stew-pan from the stove, and
gently slip the egg into it; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> must stand till the white is set; then
put it over a very moderate fire, and as soon as the water boils, the
egg is ready; take it up with a slice, and neatly round off the ragged

them into a stew-pan, and set it over a gentle fire, that they may lose

them, lay them on a warm dish. Put into a stew-pan a ladle-full of
melted bacon or lard; set it on a stove; put in about a dozen of the
small pieces of bacon, then stoop the stew-pan and break in an egg.
Manage this carefully, and the egg will presently be done: it will be
very round, and the little dice of bacon will stick to it all over, so
that it will make a very pretty appearance. Take care the yelks do not
harden; when the egg is thus done, lay it carefully in a warm dish, and

<p>Coffee, as used on the Continent, serves the double purpose of an
agreeable tonic, and an exhilarating beverage, without the unpleasant
effects of wine.</p>

<p>Coffee, as drunk in England, debilitates the stomach, and produces a
slight nausea. In France and in Italy it is made strong from the best
coffee, and is poured out hot and transparent.</p>

muddy, and drowned in a deluge of water, and sometimes deserves the

<h3 class="recipe"><i>My Pudding.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_554" id="no_554"></a>No. 554.)</h3>

<p>Beat up the yelks and whites of three eggs; strain them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span> through a sieve
(to keep out the treddles), and gradually add to them about a quarter of
a pint of milk,&mdash;stir these well together; rub together in a mortar two
ounces of moist sugar, and as much grated nutmeg as will lie on a
sixpence,&mdash;stir these into the eggs and milk; then put in four ounces of
flour, and beat it into a smooth batter; by degrees stir into it seven
ounces of suet (minced as fine as possible), and three ounces of
bread-crumbs; mix all thoroughly together at least half an hour before
you put the pudding into the pot; put it into an earthenware
pudding-mould that you have well buttered; tie a pudding-cloth over it
very tight; put it into boiling water, and boil it three hours.</p>

<p>Put one good plum into it, and Moost-Aye says, you may then tell the
economist that you have made a good plum pudding&mdash;without plums: this
would be what schoolboys call &#8220;mile-stone pudding,&#8221; <i>i. e.</i> &#8220;a mile
between one plum and another.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="nb-554" id="nb-554"></a>N.B. Half a pound of Muscatel raisins cut in half, and added to the
above, will make a most admirable plum pudding: a little grated
lemon-peel may be added.</p>

<p><a name="obs-554" id="obs-554"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;If the water ceases to boil, the pudding will become heavy, and
be spoiled; if properly managed, this and the following will be as fine
puddings of the kind as art can produce.</p>

<p>Puddings are best when mixed an hour or two before they are boiled; the
ingredients by that means amalgamate, and the whole becomes richer and
fuller of flavour, especially if the various articles be thoroughly well
stirred together.</p>

<p>A table-spoonful of treacle will give it a rich brown colour. See
pudding sauce, <a href="#no_269">No. 269</a>, and pudding catchup, <a href="#no_446">No. 446</a>.</p>

<p><a name="nb-554-1" id="nb-554-1"></a>N.B. This pudding may be baked in an oven, or under meat, the same as
Yorkshire pudding (<a href="#no_552">No. 552</a>); make it the same, only add half a pint of
milk more: should it be above an inch and a quarter in thickness, it
will take full two hours: it requires careful watching, for if the top
gets burned, an empyreumatic flavour will pervade the whole of the
pudding. Or, butter some tin mince-pie patty-pans, or saucers, and fill
them with pudding, and set them in a Dutch oven; they will take about an
hour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Maigre Plum Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Simmer half a pint of milk with two blades of mace, and a roll of
lemon-peel, for ten minutes; then strain it into a basin; set it away to
get cold: in the mean time beat three eggs in a basin with three ounces
of loaf-sugar, and the third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span> of a nutmeg: then add three ounces of
flour; beat it well together, and add the milk by degrees: then put in
three ounces of fresh butter broken into small pieces, and three ounces
of bread-crumbs; three ounces of currants washed and picked clean, three
ounces of raisins stoned and chopped: stir it all well together. Butter
a mould; put it in, and tie a cloth tight over it. Boil it two hours and
a half. Serve it up with melted butter, two table-spoonfuls of brandy,
and a little loaf-sugar.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>A Fat Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Break five eggs in a basin; beat them up with a tea-spoonful of sugar
and a table-spoonful of flour; beat it quite smooth; then put to it a
pound of raisins, and a pound of suet; it must not be chopped very fine;
butter a mould well; put in the pudding; tie a cloth over it tight, and
boil it five hours.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-343" id="nb-p-343"></a>N.B. This is very rich, and is commonly called a marrow pudding.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Pease Pudding.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_555" id="no_555"></a>No. 555.)</h3>

<p>Put a quart of split pease into a clean cloth; do not tie them up too
close, but leave a little room for them to swell; put them on in cold
water, to boil slowly till they are tender: if they are good pease they
will be boiled enough in about two hours and a half; rub them through a
sieve into a deep dish, adding<a name="FNanchor_343-1_247" id="FNanchor_343-1_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_343-1_247" class="fnanchor">343-*</a> to them an egg or two, an ounce of
butter, and some pepper and salt; beat them well together for about ten
minutes, when these ingredients are well incorporated together; then
flour the cloth well, put the pudding in, and tie it up as tight as
possible, and boil it an hour longer. It is as good with boiled beef as
it is with boiled pork; and why not with roasted pork?</p>

<p><a name="obs-555" id="obs-555"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;This is a very good accompaniment to cold pork or cold beef.</p>

<p><a name="nb-555" id="nb-555"></a>N.B. Stir this pudding into two quarts of the liquor meat or poultry has
been boiled in; give it a boil up, and in five minutes it will make
excellent extempore pease soup, especially if the pudding has been
boiled in the same pot as the meat (see <a href="#no_218">No. 218</a>, &amp;c.) Season it with
pease powder, <a href="#no_458">No. 458</a>.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Plain Bread Pudding.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_556" id="no_556"></a>No. 556.)</h3>

<p>Make five ounces of bread-crumbs; put them in a basin; pour three
quarters of a pint of boiling milk over them; put a plate over the top
to keep in the steam; let it stand twenty minutes, then beat it up quite
smooth with two ounces of sugar and a salt-spoonful of nutmeg. Break
four eggs on a plate, leaving out one white; beat them well, and add
them to the pudding. Stir it all well together, and put it in a mould
that has been well buttered and floured; tie a cloth over it, and boil
it one hour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Bread and butter Pudding.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_557" id="no_557"></a>No. 557.)</h3>

<p>You must have a dish that will hold a quart: wash and pick two ounces of
currants; strew a few at the bottom of the dish; cut about four layers
of very thin bread and butter, and between each layer of bread and
butter strew some currants; then break four eggs in a basin, leaving out
one white; beat them well, and add four ounces of sugar and a drachm of
nutmeg; stir it well together with a pint of new milk; pour it over
about ten minutes before you put it in the oven; it will take three
quarters of an hour to bake.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Pancakes and Fritters.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_558" id="no_558"></a>No. 558.)</h3>

<p>Break three eggs in a basin; beat them up with a little nutmeg and salt;
then put to them four ounces and a half of flour, and a little milk;
beat it of a smooth batter; then add by degrees as much milk as will
make it of the thickness of good cream: the frying-pan must be about the
size of a pudding plate, and very clean, or they will stick; make it
hot, and to each pancake put in a bit of butter about as big as a
walnut: when it is melted, pour in the batter to cover the bottom of the
pan; make them the thickness of half a crown; fry them of a light brown
on both sides.</p>

<p>The above will do for apple fritters, by adding one spoonful more of
flour; peel your apples, and cut them in thick slices; take out the
core, dip them in the batter, and fry them in hot lard; put them on a
sieve to drain; dish them neatly, and grate some loaf-sugar over them.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Tansy Pancakes.</i></h3>

<p>The batter for the preceding may be made into tansy pancakes by cutting

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Boston Apple Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Peel one dozen and a half of good apples; take out the cores, cut them
small, put into a stew-pan that will just hold them, with a little
water, a little cinnamon, two cloves, and the peel of a lemon; stew over
a slow fire till quite soft, then sweeten with moist sugar, and pass it
through a hair sieve; add to it the yelks of four eggs and one white, a
quarter of a pound of good butter, half a nutmeg, the peel of a lemon
grated, and the juice of one lemon: beat all well together; line the
inside of a pie-dish with good puff paste; put in the pudding, and bake
half an hour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Spring Fruit Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Peel, and well wash four dozen sticks of rhubarb: put into a stew-pan
with the pudding a lemon, a little cinnamon, and as much moist sugar as
will make it quite sweet; set it over a fire, and reduce it to a
marmalade; pass through a hair-sieve, and proceed as directed for the
Boston pudding, leaving out the lemon-juice, as the rhubarb will be
found sufficiently acid of itself.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Nottingham Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Peel six good apples; take out the core with the point of a small knife,
or an apple corer, if you have one; but be sure to leave the apples
whole; fill up where you took the core from with sugar; place them in a
pie-dish, and pour over them a nice light batter, prepared as for batter
pudding, and bake an hour in a moderate oven.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Butter Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Take six ounces of fine flour, a little salt, and three eggs; beat up
well with a little milk, added by degrees till the batter is quite
smooth; make it the thickness of cream; put into a buttered pie-dish,
and bake three quarters of an hour; or into a buttered and floured
basin, tied over tight with a cloth: boil one and a half hour, or two
hours.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Newmarket Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Put on to boil a pint of good milk, with half a lemon-peel, a little
cinnamon, and a bay-leaf; boil gently for five or ten minutes; sweeten
with loaf sugar; break the yelks of five, and the whites of three eggs,
into a basin; beat them well, and add the milk: beat all well together,
and strain through a fine hair-sieve, or tamis: have some bread and
butter cut very thin; lay a layer of it in a pie-dish, and then a layer
of currants, and so on till the dish is nearly full; then pour the
custard over it, and bake half an hour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Newcastle, or Cabinet Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Butter a half melon mould, or quart basin, and stick all round with

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Vermicelli Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Boil a pint of milk, with lemon-peel and cinnamon; sweeten with
loaf-sugar; strain through a sieve, and add a quarter of a pound of
vermicelli; boil ten minutes; then put in the yelks of five, and the
whites of three eggs; mix well together, and steam it one hour and a
quarter: the same may be baked half an hour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Bread Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Make a pint of bread-crumbs; put them in a stew-pan with as much milk as
will cover them, the peel of a lemon, a little nutmeg grated, and a
small piece of cinnamon; boil about ten minutes; sweeten with powdered
loaf-sugar; take out the cinnamon, and put in four eggs; beat all well
together, and bake half an hour, or boil rather more than an hour.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Custard Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Boil a pint of milk, and a quarter of a pint of good cream; thicken with
flour and water made perfectly smooth, till it is stiff enough to bear
an egg on it; break in the yelks of five eggs; sweeten with powdered
loaf-sugar; grate in a little nutmeg and the peel of a lemon: add half a
glass of good brandy; then whip the whites of the five eggs till quite
stiff, and mix gently all together: line a pie-dish with good puff
paste, and bake half an hour.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-347" id="nb-p-347"></a>N.B. Ground rice, potato flour, panada, and all puddings made from

<p>Put a quart of new milk into a stew-pan, with the peel of a lemon cut
very thin, a little grated nutmeg, a bay or laurel-leaf, and a small
stick of cinnamon; set it over a quick fire, but be careful it does not
boil over: when it boils, set it beside the fire, and simmer ten
minutes; break the yelks of eight, and the whites of four eggs into a
basin; beat them well; then pour in the milk a little at a time,
stirring it as quick as possible to prevent the eggs curdling; set it on
the fire again, and stir it well with a wooden spoon; let it have just
one boil; pass it through a tamis, or fine sieve: when cold, add a
little brandy, or white wine, as may be most agreeable to the eater&#8217;s
palate. Serve up in glasses, or cups.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">TO DRESS SPRING FRUIT.</h3>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Spring Fruit Soup.</i></h3>

<p>Peel and well wash four dozen sticks of rhubarb; blanch it in water
three or four minutes; drain it on a sieve, and put it into a stew-pan,
with two onions sliced, a carrot, an ounce of lean ham, and a good bit
of butter; let it stew gently over a slow fire till tender; then put in
two quarts of good <i>consomm&eacute;</i>, to which add two or three ounces of
bread-crumbs; boil about fifteen minutes; skim off all the fat; season
with salt and Cayenne pepper; pass it through a tamis, and serve up with
fried bread.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Spring Fruit Pudding.</i></h3>

<p>Clean as above three or four dozen sticks of rhubarb; put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span> it in a
stew-pan, with the peel of a lemon, a bit of cinnamon, two cloves, and
as much moist sugar as will sweeten it; set it over a fire, and reduce
it to a marmalade; pass it through a hair-sieve; then add the peel of a
lemon, and half a nutmeg grated, a quarter of a pound of good butter,
and the yelks of four eggs and one white, and mix all well together;
line a pie-dish, that will just contain it, with good puff paste; put
the mixture in, and bake it half an hour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Spring Fruit&mdash;A Mock Gooseberry Sauce for Mackerel, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<p>Make a marmalade of three dozen sticks of rhubarb, sweetened with moist
sugar; pass it through a hair-sieve, and serve up in a sauce-boat.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Spring Fruit Tart.</i></h3>

<p>Prepare rhubarb as above: cut it into small pieces into a tart-dish;
sweeten with loaf-sugar pounded; cover it with a good short crust paste;
sift a little sugar over the top, and bake half an hour in a rather hot
oven: serve up cold.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Spring Cream, or mock Gooseberry Fool.</i></h3>

<p>Prepare a marmalade as directed for the pudding: to which add a pint of
good thick cream; serve up in glasses, or in a deep dish. If wanted in a
shape, dissolve two ounces of isinglass in a little water; strain it
through a tamis, and when nearly cold put it to the cream; pour it into
a jelly mould, and when set, turn out into a dish, and serve up plain.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Spring Fruit Sherbet.</i></h3>

<p>Boil six or eight sticks of rhubarb (quite clean) ten minutes in a quart
of water; strain the liquor through a tamis into a jug, with the peel of
a lemon cut very thin, and two table-spoonfuls of clarified sugar; let
it stand five or six hours, and it is fit to drink.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Gourds</i> (now called <i>vegetable Marrow</i>) <i>stewed.</i></h3>

<p>Take off all the skin of six or eight gourds, put them into a stew-pan,

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Gourd Soup</i>,</h3>

<p>Should be made of full-grown gourds, but not those that have hard skins;
slice three or four, and put them in a stew-pan, with two or three
onions, and a good bit of butter; set them over a slow fire till quite
tender (be careful not to let them burn); then add two ounces of crust
of bread, and two quarts of good <i>consomm&eacute;</i>; season with salt and
Cayenne pepper: boil ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour; skim off all
the fat, and pass it through a tamis; then make it quite hot, and serve
up with fried bread.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Fried Gourds.</i></h3>

<p>Cut five or six gourds in quarters; take off the skin and pulp; stew
them in the same manner as for table: when done, drain them quite dry;
beat up an egg, and dip the gourds in it, and cover them well over with
bread-crumbs; make some hog&#8217;s-lard hot, and fry them a nice light
colour; throw a little salt and pepper over them, and serve up quite
dry.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Another Way.</i></h3>

<p>Take six or eight small gourds, as near of a size as possible; slice
them with a cucumber-slice; dry them in a cloth, and then fry them in
very hot lard; throw over a little pepper and salt, and serve up on a
napkin. Great attention is requisite to do these well; if the fat is
quite hot they are done in a minute, and will soon spoil; if not hot
enough, they will eat greasy and tough.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>To make Beef, Mutton, or Veal Tea.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_563" id="no_563"></a>No. 563.)</h3>

<p>Cut a pound of lean gravy meat into thin slices; put it into a quart and
half a pint of cold water; set it over a very gentle fire, where it will
become gradually warm; when the scum rises, let it continue simmering
gently for about an hour; then strain it through a fine sieve or a
napkin; let it stand ten minutes to settle, and then pour off the clear
tea.</p>

<p><a name="nb-563" id="nb-563"></a>N.B. An onion, and a few grains of black pepper, are sometimes added.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Mutton Broth for the Sick.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_564" id="no_564"></a>No. 564.)</h3>

<p>Have a pound and a half of a neck or loin of mutton; take off the skin
and the fat, and put it into a saucepan; cover it with cold water, (it
will take about a quart to a pound of meat,) let it simmer very gently,
and skim it well; cover it up, and set it over a moderate fire, where it
may stand gently stewing for about an hour; then strain it off. It
should be allowed to become cold, when all the greasy particles will
float on the surface, and becoming hard, can be easily taken off, and
the settlings will remain at the bottom.</p>

only mutton broth that should be given to convalescents, whose

delicate stomach, when the least addition of other ingredients would
immediately offend it.</p>

put it into half a pint of boiling water, and let it boil for five
minutes; pour off this water, and add to it two quarts of boiling water:
boil it to two pints, and strain it.</p>

<p>The above is simple barley water. To a quart of this is frequently added</p>

attendant, is frequently demanded by honest instinct, in terms too plain
to be misunderstood: the stomach sympathizes with every fibre of the

<p>In no branch of the practice of physic is there more dangerous quackery,
than in the dental department.</p>

<p>To all people the toothache is an intolerable torment; not even a

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Stomachic Tincture</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_569" id="no_569"></a>No. 569.)&mdash;is</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>Peruvian bark, bruised, one ounce and a half.</li>
  <li>Orange-peel, <span style="padding-left: 1.2em; padding-right: 1em;">do.</span> one ounce.</li>
  <li>Brandy, or proof spirit, one pint.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let these ingredients steep for ten days, shaking the bottle every day;
let it remain quiet two days, and then decant the clear liquor.</p>

<p>Dose&mdash;a tea-spoonful in a wineglass of water, twice a day, when you feel
languid, <i>i. e.</i> when the stomach is empty, about an hour before dinner,
and in the evening.</p>

<p>This agreeable aromatic tonic is an effective help to concoction; and we
are under personal obligations to it, for frequently restoring our
stomach to good temper, and procuring us good appetite and good
digestion.</p>

<p>In low nervous affections arising from a languid circulation, and when
the stomach is in a state of debility from age, intemperance, or other
causes, this is a most acceptable restorative.</p>

stomach is empty, is very grateful and strengthening to it.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Dr. Kitchiner&#8217;s Receipt to make Gruel.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_572" id="no_572"></a>No. 572.)</h3>

<p>Ask those who are to eat it, if they like it thick or thin; if the
latter, mix well together by degrees, in a pint basin, one

two spoonfuls.</p>

<p>Plain gruel, such as is directed in the first part of this receipt, is
one of the best breakfasts and suppers that we can recommend to the
rational epicure; is the most comforting soother of an irritable stomach
that we know; and particularly acceptable to it after a hard day&#8217;s work
of intemperate feasting: when the addition of half an ounce of butter,
and a tea-spoonful of Epsom salt, will give it an aperient quality,
which will assist the principal viscera to get rid of their burden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Water gruel,&#8221; says Tryon in his <a name="corr83" id="corr83"></a><i>Obs. on Health</i>, 16mo. 1688, p. 42, is
&#8220;the king of spoon meats,&#8221; and &#8220;the queen of soups,&#8221; and gratifies
nature beyond all others.</p>

<p>In the &#8220;Art of Thriving,&#8221; 1697, p. 8, are directions for preparing
fourscore noble and wholesome dishes, upon most of which a man may live
excellently well for two-pence a day; the author&#8217;s Obs. on water gruel
is, that &#8220;essence of oatmeal makes a noble and exhilarating meal!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin&#8217;s favourite breakfast was a good basin of warm gruel, in
which there was a small slice of butter, with toasted bread and nutmeg;
the expense of this he reckoned at three halfpence.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Scotch Burgoo.</i>&mdash;(<a name="no_572-1" id="no_572-1"></a>No. 572*.)</h3>

of food. It possesses the grand qualities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span> salubrity, pleasantness,
and cheapness. It is, in fact, a sort of oatmeal hasty pudding without
milk; much used by those patterns of combined industry, frugality, and
temperance, the Scottish peasantry; and this, among other examples of
the economical Scotch, is well worthy of being occasionally adopted by
all who have large families and small incomes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is made in the following easy and expeditious manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;To a quart of oatmeal add gradually two quarts of water, so that the
whole may smoothly mix: then stirring it continually over the fire, boil
it together for a quarter of an hour; after which, take it up, and stir
in a little salt and butter, with or without pepper. This quantity will
serve a family of five or six persons for a moderate meal.&#8221;&mdash;Oddy&#8217;s

been already sufficiently dressed, as it neither consumes the sauce, nor
hardens the meat. If you have not a water-bath a Dutch oven will
sometimes supply the place of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bain-marie</i> is a flat vessel containing boiling water; you put all
your stew-pans into the water, and keep that water always very hot, but
it must not boil: the effect of this <i>bain-marie</i> is to keep every thing
warm without altering either the quantity or the quality, particularly
the quality. When I had the honour of serving a nobleman, who kept a
very extensive hunting establishment, and the hour of dinner was
consequently uncertain, I was in the habit of using <i>bain-marie</i>, as a
certain means of preserving the flavour of all my dishes. If you keep
your sauce, or broth, or soup, by the fireside, the soup reduces, and
becomes too strong, and the sauce thickens as well as reduces. This is
the best way of warming turtle, or mock turtle soup, as the thick part
is always at the bottom, and this method prevents it from burning, and
keeps it always good.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ude&#8217;s</span> <i>Cookery</i>, page 18.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the tea into a kettle with cold water; cover it close, set it on
the fire, and make it all but boil; when you see a sort of white scum on
the surface, take it from the fire; when the leaves sink it is ready.&#8221;</p>

<p class="titlepage">3.</p>

<p><a name="corr86" id="corr86"></a>&#8220;The night before you wish to have tea ready for drinking, pour on it as
much cold water as you wish to make tea; next morning pour off the clear
liquor, and when you wish to drink it, make it warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The above are from &#8220;<i>L&#8217;Art du Limonadier</i>&#8221; <i>de</i> <span class="smcap">Dubuisson</span>, Paris, p.
267, 268. Or,</p>

<p class="titlepage">4.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great saving may be made by making a tincture of tea, thus: pour
boiling water upon it, and let it stand twenty minutes, putting into
each cup no more than is necessary to fill it about one-third full: fill
each cup up with hot water from an urn or kettle; thus the tea will be
always hot and equally strong to the end, and one tea-spoonful will be
found enough for three cups for each person: according to the present
mode of making it, three times the quantity is often used.&#8221;&mdash;See Dr.
<span class="smcap">Trusler&#8217;s</span> <i>Way to be Rich and Respectable</i>, 8vo. 1796, page 27.</p>

<p>[Tea should only be made as an infusion,&mdash;that is, pouring boiling hot
water upon it, and letting it stand a few minutes to draw. A.]</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>In the foregoing table, we have given the proportions of <i>bone</i> to
<i>meat</i>,&mdash;the former not being weighed till cooked, by which, of course,
its weight was considerably diminished.</p>

<p>These proportions differ in almost every animal,&mdash;and from the different
manner in which they are cut.</p>

<p>Those who pay the highest, do not always pay the <i>dearest</i> price. In
fact, the best meat is the <i>cheapest</i>; and those who treat a tradesman
liberally, have a much better chance of being well served, than those
who are for ever bargaining for the market penny. In dividing the
joints, there is always an opportunity of apportioning the bones, fat,
flaps, &amp;c., so as to make up a variation of much more than a penny per
pound in most pieces; and a butcher will be happy to give the turn of
his knife in favour of that customer who cheerfully pays the fair price
of the article he purchases:&mdash;have those who are unwilling to do so any
reason to complain?&mdash;have they not invited such conduct?</p>

<p>The <i>quality</i> of butcher&#8217;s meat, varies quite as much as the <i>price</i> of
it, according to its age, how it has been fed, and especially how it has
been treated the week before it has been killed.</p>

<p>The following statements were sent to us by a very respectable
tradesman:&mdash;</p>

<p>Beef is <i>best</i> and <i>cheapest</i> from Michaelmas to Midsummer. The price,
per pound, now varies from 4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Veal is <i>best</i> from March to July. The price varies according to the
season and the supply; and the quality differs so much, that the same
joints now sell from 5<i>d</i>. to 11<i>d.</i> per pound.</p>

<p>Mutton is <i>best</i> from Christmas to Midsummer; the difference in price
between the worst and the best, is now from 5<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i> per pound.</p>

<p>Grass lamb is <i>best</i> from Easter to June; house lamb from Christmas to
June.</p>

<p>The <i>price of it</i> varies as much as the size and quality of it, and the
supply at market, and the demand for it.</p>

<p>It is generally <i>dearest</i> from March to July, when the town is fullest;
and <i>cheapest</i> about September, when the game season commences, and the
weather being colder, allows of its being brought from more distant
parts, and the town becoming thin, there is less demand for it.</p>

<p>The above information will, we trust, be very acceptable to economical
families, who, from hearing the very high price poultry sometimes costs,
are deterred from ever inquiring about it. In the cheap seasons, we have
noted, it is sometimes as cheap as butcher&#8217;s meat.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Raised Pies.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_5" id="ap_no_5"></a>No. 5.)</h3>

<p>Put two pounds and a half of flour on the pasteboard; and put on the
fire, in a saucepan, three quarters of a pint of water, and half a pound
of good lard; when the water boils, make a hole in the middle of the
flour, pour in the water and lard by degrees, gently mixing the flour
with it with a spoon; and when it is well mixed, then knead it with your
hands till it becomes stiff: dredge a little flour to prevent its
sticking to the board, or you cannot make it look smooth: do not roll it
with the rolling-pin, but roll it with your hands, about the thickness
of a quart pot; cut it into six pieces, leaving a little for the covers;
put one hand in the middle, and keep the other close on the outside till
you have worked it either in an oval or a round shape: have your meat
ready cut, and seasoned with pepper and salt: if pork, cut in small
slices; the griskin is the best for pasties: if you use mutton, cut it
in very neat cutlets, and put them in the pies as you make them; roll
out the covers with the rolling-pin just the size of the pie, wet it
round the edge, put it on the pie, and press it together with your thumb
and finger, and then cut it all round with a pair of scissors quite
even, and pinch them inside and out, and bake them an hour and a half.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Paste for boiled Puddings.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_6" id="ap_no_6"></a>No. 6.)</h3>

<p>Pick and chop very fine half a pound of beef suet, add to it one pound
and a quarter of flour, and a little salt: mix it with half a pint of
milk or water, and beat it well with the rolling-pin, to incorporate the
suet with the flour.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Paste for stringing Tartlets, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_7" id="ap_no_7"></a>No. 7.)</h3>

<p>Mix with your hands a quarter of a pound of flour, an ounce of fresh
butter, and a little cold water; rub it well between the board and your
hand till it begins to string; cut it into small pieces, roll it out,
and draw it into fine strings, lay them across your tartlets in any
device you please, and bake them immediately.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Venison Pasty.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_9" id="ap_no_9"></a>No. 9.)</h3>

<p>Take a neck, shoulder, or breast of venison, that has not hung too long;
bone them, trim off all the skin, and cut it into pieces two inches
square, and put them into a stew-pan, with three gills of Port wine, two
onions, or a few eschalots sliced; some pepper, salt, three blades of
mace, about a dozen allspice, and enough veal broth to cover it; put it
over a slow fire, and let it stew till three parts done; put the
trimmings into another saucepan, cover it with water, and set it on a
fire. Take out the pieces you intend for the pasty, and put them into a
deep dish with a little of their liquor, and set it by to cool; then add
the remainder of the liquor to the bones and trimmings, and boil it till
the pasty is ready; then cover the pasty with paste made like <a href="#ap_no_5">No. 5</a>;
ornament the top, and bake it for two hours in a slow oven; and before
it is sent to table, pour in a sauce made with the gravy the venison was
stewed in, strained and skimmed free from fat; some pepper, salt, half a
gill of Port, the juice of half a lemon, and a little flour and butter
to thicken it.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Mutton or Veal Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_10" id="ap_no_10"></a>No. 10.)</h3>

<p>Cut into chops, and trim neatly, and cut away the greatest part of the
fat of a loin, or best end of a neck of mutton (the former the best),
season them, and lay them in a pie dish, with a little water and half a
gill of mushroom catchup (chopped onion and potatoes, if approved);
cover it with paste (<a href="#ap_no_2">No. 2</a>), bake it two hours; when done, lift up the
crust from the dish with a knife, pour out all the gravy, let it stand,
and skim it clean; add, if wanted, some more seasoning; make it boil,
and pour it into the pie.</p>

<p>Veal pie may be made of the brisket part of the breast; but must be
parboiled first.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Hare Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_11" id="ap_no_11"></a>No. 11.)</h3>

<p>Take the hare skinned and washed, cut it into pieces, and parboil it for
two minutes to cleanse it; wash it well, and put it in a stew-pot with
six eschalots chopped, a gill of Port wine, a small quantity of thyme,
savoury, sweet marjoram, and parsley, tied in a bunch, four cloves, and
half a dozen allspice; cover it with veal broth, and stew it till half
done; pick out the prime pieces, such as the back, legs, &amp;c. (leaving
the remainder to stew till the goodness is quite extracted); take the
parts preserved, and fill them into a dish with some water, and cover it
with paste as <a href="#ap_no_2">No. 2</a>; bake it an hour;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span> strain the gravy from the
trimmings, thicken it a little, and throw in half a gill of Port, the
juice of half a lemon, and pour it into the pie boiling hot; line the
bottom of the dish with Hare stuffing (<a href="#no_379">No. 379</a>), or make it into
forcemeat balls.</p>

<p>Pies of game and wild fowl are made in like manner; and as the following
receipt for Pigeon pie.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Savoury Pies, Pasties, and Patties.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_12" id="ap_no_12"></a>No. 12.)</h3>

<p>The <i>piquance</i> of pies may be regulated <i>ad libitum</i>, by sprinkling the
articles with zest (<a href="#no_recipe">No. 255</a>), curry powder <a name="corr92" id="corr92"></a>(<a href="#no_455">No. 455</a>, and see Nos. <a href="#no_457">457</a>
and <a href="#no_459">459</a>), or by covering the bottom of the dish with any of the
forcemeats enumerated in Nos. <a href="#no_373">373</a> to <a href="#no_recipe">385</a>, and making it into balls; lay
one ring of these, and another of hard-boiled eggs cut in halves, round
the top of the pie; and instead of putting in water, put strong gravy.
After the pies are baked, pour in through a funnel any of the various
gravies, sauces, &amp;c.: truffles, mushrooms, wine, spices, pickles, &amp;c.
are also added. See also Nos. <a href="#no_396">396</a> to <a href="#no_402">402</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span> These are dishes contrived rather to excite appetite than to
satisfy it. Putting meat or poultry into a pie is certainly the very
worst way of cooking it; it is often baked to rags; and very rarely
indeed does a savoury pie come to table that deserves to be introduced
to the stomach.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Pigeon or Lark Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_13" id="ap_no_13"></a>No. 13.)</h3>

<p>Truss half a dozen fine large pigeons as for stewing, season them with
pepper and salt; lay at the bottom of the dish a rump-steak of about a
pound weight, cut into pieces and trimmed neatly, seasoned, and beat out
with a chopper: on it lay the pigeons, the yelks of three eggs boiled
hard, and a gill of broth or water, and over these a layer of steaks;
wet the edge of the dish, and cover it over with puff paste (<a href="#ap_no_1">No. 1</a>), or
the paste as directed for seasoned pies (<a href="#ap_no_2">No. 2</a>); wash it over with yelk
of egg, and ornament it with leaves of paste and the feet of the
pigeons; bake it an hour and a half in a moderate-heated oven: before it
is sent to table make an aperture in the top, and pour in some good
gravy quite hot.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Giblet Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_14" id="ap_no_14"></a>No. 14.)</h3>

<p>Clean well, and half stew two or three sets of goose giblets: cut the
legs in two, the wing and neck into three, and the gizzard into four
pieces; preserve the liquor, and set the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span> giblets by till cold,
otherwise the heat of the giblets will spoil the paste you cover the pie
with: then season the whole with black pepper and salt, and put them
into a deep dish; cover it with paste as directed in <a href="#ap_no_2">No. 2</a>, rub it over
with yelk of egg, ornament and bake it an hour and a half in a moderate
oven: in the meantime take the liquor the giblets were stewed in, skim
it free from fat, put it over a fire in a clean stew-pan, thicken it a
little with flour and butter, or flour and water, season it with pepper
and salt, and the juice of half a lemon; add a few drops of browning,
strain it through a fine sieve, and when you take the pie from the oven,
pour some of this into it through a funnel. Some lay in the bottom of
the dish a moderately thick rump-steak: if you have any cold game or
poultry, cut it in pieces, and add it to the above.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Rump-Steak Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_15" id="ap_no_15"></a>No. 15.)</h3>

<p>Cut three pounds of rump-steak (that has been kept till tender) into
pieces half as big as your hand, trim off all the skin, sinews, and
every part which has not indisputable pretensions to be eaten, and beat
them with a chopper: chop very fine half a dozen eschalots, and add them
to half an ounce of pepper and salt mixed; strew some of the mixture at
the bottom of the dish, then a layer of steak, then some more of the
mixture, and so on till the dish is full; add half a gill of mushroom
catchup, and the same quantity of gravy, or red wine; cover it as in the
preceding receipt, and bake it two hours.</p>

<p><a name="nb-ap-15" id="nb-ap-15"></a>N.B. Large oysters, parboiled, bearded, and laid alternately with the
steaks, their liquor reduced and substituted instead of the catchup and
wine, will be a variety.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Chicken Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_16" id="ap_no_16"></a>No. 16.)</h3>

<p>Parboil, and then cut up neatly two young chickens; dry them; set them
over a slow fire for a few minutes; have ready some veal stuffing or
forcemeat (<a href="#no_374">No. 374</a> or <a href="#no_375">No. 375</a>), lay it at the bottom of the dish, and
place in the chickens upon it, and with it some pieces of dressed ham;
cover it with paste (<a href="#ap_no_1">No. 1</a>). Bake it from an hour and a half to two
hours; when sent to table, add some good gravy, well seasoned, and not
too thick.</p>

<p>Duck pie is made in like manner, only substituting the duck stuffing
(<a href="#no_378">No. 378</a>), instead of the veal.</p>

<p><a name="nb-ap-16" id="nb-ap-16"></a>N.B. The above may be put into a raised French crust (see <a href="#ap_no_18">No. 18</a>) and
baked; when done, take off the top, and put a rago&ucirc;t of sweetbread to
the chickens.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Rabbit Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_17" id="ap_no_17"></a>No. 17.)</h3>

<p>Made in the same way; but make a forcemeat to cover the bottom of the
dish, by pounding a quarter of a pound of boiled bacon with the livers
of the rabbits; some pepper and salt, some pounded mace, some chopped
parsley, and an eschalot, thoroughly beaten together; and you may lay
some thin slices of ready-dressed ham or bacon on the top of your
rabbits. &#8220;This pie will ask two hours baking,&#8221; says Mrs. Mary
Tillinghast, in page 29 of her 12mo. vol. of rare receipts, 1678.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Raised French Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_18" id="ap_no_18"></a>No. 18.)</h3>

<p>Make about two pounds of flour into a paste, as directed (<a href="#ap_no_5">No. 5</a>); knead
it well, and into the shape of a ball; press your thumb into the centre,
and work it by degrees into any shape (oval or round is the most
general), till about five inches high; put it on a sheet of paper, and
fill it with coarse flour or bran; roll out a covering for it about the
same thickness as the sides; cement its sides with the yelk of egg; cut
the edges quite even, and pinch it round with the finger and thumb, yelk
of egg it over with a paste-brush, and ornament it in any way fancy may
direct, with the same kind of paste. Bake it of a fine brown colour, in
a slow oven; and when done, cut out the top, remove the flour or bran,
brush it quite clean, and fill it up with a fricassee of chicken,
rabbit, or any other <i>entr&eacute;e</i> most convenient. Send it to table with a
napkin under.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Raised Ham Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_19" id="ap_no_19"></a>No. 19.)</h3>

<p>Soak a small ham four or five hours; wash and scrape it well; cut off
the knuckle, and boil it for half an hour; then take it up and trim it
very neatly; take off the rind and put it into an oval stew-pan, with a
pint of Madeira or sherry, and enough veal stock to cover it. Let it
stew for two hours, or till three parts done; take it out and set it in
a cold place; then raise a crust as in the foregoing receipt, large
enough to receive it; put in the ham, and round it the veal forcemeat;
cover and ornament; it will take about an hour and a half to bake in a
slow oven: when done, take off the cover, glaze the top, and pour round
the following sauce, viz. take the liquor the ham was stewed in; skim it
free from fat; thicken with a little flour and butter mixed together; a
few drops of browning, and some Cayenne pepper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>P.S. The above is, I think, a good way of dressing a small ham, and has
a good effect cold for a supper.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Veal and Ham Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_20" id="ap_no_20"></a>No. 20.)</h3>

<p>Take two pounds of veal cutlet, cut them in middling-sized pieces,
season with pepper and a very little salt; likewise one of raw or
dressed ham cut in slices, lay it alternately in the dish, and put some
forced or sausage meat (<a href="#no_374">No. 374</a>, or <a href="#no_375">No. 375</a>) at the top, with some
stewed button mushrooms, and the yelks of three eggs boiled hard, and a
gill of water; then proceed as with rump-steak pie.</p>

<p><a name="nb-ap-20" id="nb-ap-20"></a>N.B. The best end of a neck is the fine part for a pie, cut into chops,
and the chine bone taken away.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Raised Pork Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_21" id="ap_no_21"></a>No. 21.)</h3>

<p>Make a raised crust, of a good size, with paste (as directed in <a href="#ap_no_5">No. 5</a>),
about four inches high; take the rind and chine bone from a loin of
pork, cut it into chops, beat them with a chopper, season them with
pepper and salt, and fill your pie; put on the top and close it, and
pinch it round the edge; rub it over with yelk of egg, and bake it two
hours with a paper over it, to prevent the crust from burning. When
done, pour in some good gravy, with a little ready-mixed mustard (if
approved).</p>

<p><a name="nb-ap-21" id="nb-ap-21"></a>N.B. As the above is generally eaten cold, it is an excellent repast for
a journey, and will keep for several days.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Eel Pie.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_22" id="ap_no_22"></a>No. 22.)</h3>

<p>Take eels about half a pound each; skin, wash, and trim off the fin with
a pair of scissors, cut them into pieces three inches long, season them
with pepper and salt, and fill your dish, leaving out the heads and
tails. Add a gill of water or veal broth, cover it with paste (<a href="#ap_no_2">No. 2</a>),
rub it over with a paste-brush dipped in yelk of egg, ornament it with
some of the same paste, bake it an hour; and when done, make a hole in
the centre, and pour in the following sauce through a funnel: the
trimmings boiled in half a pint of veal stock, seasoned with pepper and
salt, a table-spoonful of lemon-juice, and thickened with flour and
water, strained through a fine sieve: add it boiling hot.</p>

<p>Bone a loin of lamb, cut into cutlets, trim them very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span> nicely, and lay
them in the bottom of a stew or frying-pan, with an ounce of butter, a
tea-spoonful of lemon-juice, and some pepper and salt: put them over a
fire, and turn them and put them to cool; then raise four or five small
pies with paste (as <a href="#ap_no_6">No. 6</a>), about the size of a tea-cup; put some veal
forcemeat at the bottom, and the cutlets upon it; roll out the top an
eighth of an inch thick, close and pinch the edges, bake them half an
hour, and when done take off the top, and pour in some good brown sauce.</p>

<p>Get rump-steaks, not too thick, beat them with a chopper, cut them into
pieces about half the size of your hand, and trim off all the skin,
sinews, &amp;c.; have ready an onion peeled and chopped fine, likewise some
potatoes peeled and cut into slices a quarter of an inch thick; rub the
inside of a basin or an oval plain mould with butter, sheet it with
paste as directed for boiled puddings (<a href="#ap_no_7">No. 7</a>); season the steaks with
pepper, salt, and a little grated nutmeg; put in a layer of steak, then
another of potatoes, and so on till it is full, occasionally throwing in
part of the chopped onion; add to it half a gill of mushroom catchup, a
table-spoonful of lemon-pickle, and half a gill of water or veal broth;
roll out a top, and close it well to prevent the water getting in; rinse
a clean cloth in hot water, sprinkle a little flour over it, and tie up
the pudding; have ready a large pot of water boiling, put it in, and
boil it two hours and a half; take it up, remove the cloth, turn it
downwards in a deep dish, and when wanted take away the basin or mould.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Vol au Vent.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_25" id="ap_no_25"></a>No. 25.)</h3>

<p>Roll off tart paste (<a href="#ap_no_3">No. 3</a>) till about the eighth of an inch thick:
then, with a tin cutter made for that purpose (about the size of the
bottom of the dish you intend sending to table), cut out the shape, and

<p>Put two quarts of new milk into a stew-pan, set it near the fire, and
stir in two table-spoonfuls of rennet: let it stand till it is set (this

into a colander to drain; when quite dry, put it in a mortar, and pound
it quite smooth; then add four ounces of sugar, pounded and sifted, and
three ounces of fresh butter; oil it first by putting it in a little
potting-pot, and setting it near the fire; stir it all well together:
beat the yelks of four eggs in a basin, with a little nutmeg grated,
lemon-peel, and a glass of brandy; add this to the curd, with two ounces
of currants, washed and picked; stir it all well together; have your

<h3 class="recipe"><i>To preserve Ginger.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_97" id="ap_no_97"></a>No. 97.)</h3>

<p>Take green ginger, pare it neatly with a sharp knife; throw it into a
pan of cold water as it is pared, to keep it white; when you have
sufficient, boil it till tender, changing the water three times; each
time put it into cold water to take out the heat or spirit of the
ginger; when tender, throw it into cold water: for seven pounds of
ginger, clarify eight pounds of refined sugar, see <a href="#no_475">No. 475</a>; when cold,
drain the ginger, and put it in an earthen pan, with enough of the
sugar, cold, to cover it, and let it stand two days; then pour the syrup
from the ginger to the remainder of the sugar; boil it some time, and
when cold, pour it on the ginger again, and set it by three days at
least. Then take the syrup from the ginger; boil it, and put it hot over
the ginger; proceed in this way till you find the sugar has entered the
ginger, boiling the syrup, and skimming off the scum that rises each
time, until the syrup becomes rich as well as the ginger.</p>

<p><a name="obs-ap-97" id="obs-ap-97"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;If you put the syrup on hot at first, or if too rich, the ginger
will shrink, and not take the sugar.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><p><a name="Footnote_376-1_249" id="Footnote_376-1_249"></a><a href="#FNanchor_376-1_249"><span class="label">376-*</span></a> The goodness of a cake or biscuit depends much on its
being well baked; great attention should be paid to the different
degrees of heat of the oven: be sure to have it of a good sound heat at
first, when, after its being well cleaned out, may be baked such
articles as require a hot oven, after which such as are directed to be
baked in a well-heated or moderate oven; and, lastly, those in a slow
soaking or cool one. With a little care the above degrees may soon be
known.</p>

<p>In making butter cakes, such as Nos. <a href="#no_55">55</a>, <a href="#no_57">57</a>, or <a href="#no_61">61</a>, too much attention
cannot be paid to have the butter well creamed; for should it be made
too warm, it would, cause the mixture to be the same, and when put to
bake, the fruit, sweetmeats, &amp;c. would, in that event, fall to the
bottom.</p>

<p>Yest cakes should be well proved before put into the oven, as they will
prove but little afterward.</p>

<p>In making biscuits and cakes where butter is not used, the different
utensils should be kept free from all kinds of grease, or it is next to
impossible to have good ones.</p>

<p>In buttering the insides of cake-moulds, the butter should be nicely
clarified, and when nearly cold, laid on quite smooth, with a small
brush kept for that purpose.</p>

<p>Sugar and flour should be quite dry, and a drum sieve is recommended for
the sugar. The old way of beating the yelks and whites of eggs separate
(except in very few cases), is not only useless, but a waste of time.
They should be well incorporated with the other ingredients, and, in
some instances, they cannot be beaten too much.</p>

a cone, about five inches over at the top. Cut a small hole at the

biscuits or cakes to be made. When the various mixtures are put in, lay
the pipe close to the paper, and press it out in rows.</p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="OBSERVATIONS_ON_PUDDINGS_AND_PIES" id="OBSERVATIONS_ON_PUDDINGS_AND_PIES"></a>OBSERVATIONS ON PUDDINGS AND PIES.</h3>


<p>The quality of the various articles employed in the composition of
puddings and pies varies so much, that two puddings, made exactly
according to the same receipt, will be so different<a name="FNanchor_392-1_253" id="FNanchor_392-1_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_392-1_253" class="fnanchor">392-*</a> one would
hardly suppose they were made by the same person, and certainly not with
precisely the same quantities of the (apparently) same ingredients.
Flour fresh ground, pure new milk, fresh laid eggs, fresh butter, fresh
suet, &amp;c. will make a very different composition, than when kept till
each article is half spoiled.</p>

<p>Plum puddings, when boiled, if hung up in a cool place in the cloth they
are boiled in, will keep good some months; when wanted, take them out of
the cloth, and put them into a clean cloth, and as soon as warmed
through, they are ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span>&mdash;In composing these receipts, the quantities of eggs, butter, &amp;c.
are considerably less than are ordered in other cookery books; but quite
sufficient for the purpose of making the puddings light and
wholesome;&mdash;we have diminished the expense, without impoverishing the
preparations; and the rational epicure will be as well pleased with them
as the rational economist.</p>

<p>Milk, in its genuine state, varies considerably in the quantity of cream
it will throw up, depending on the material with which the cow is fed.
The cow that gives the most milk does not always produce the most cream,
which varies fifteen or twenty per cent.</p>

<p>Eggs vary considerably in size; in the following receipts we mean the
full-sized hen&#8217;s egg; if you have only pullet&#8217;s eggs, use two for one.
Break eggs one by one into a basin, and not all into the bowl together;
because then, if you meet with a bad one, that will spoil all the rest:
strain them through a sieve to take out the treddles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>N.B. To preserve eggs for twelve months, see <a href="#nb-547">N.B.</a> to <a href="#no_547">No. 547</a>. Snow, and
small beer, have been recommended by some economists as admirable
substitutes for eggs; they will no more answer this purpose than as
substitutes for sugar or brandy.</p>

<p>Flour, according to that champion against adulteration, Mr. Accum,
varies in quality as much as any thing.</p>

<p>Butter also varies much in quality. Salt butter may be washed from the
salt, and then it will make very good pastry.</p>

<p>Lard varies extremely from the time it is kept, &amp;c. When you purchase
it, have the bladder cut, and ascertain that it be sweet and good.</p>

<p>Suet. Beef is the best, then mutton and veal; when this is used in very
hot weather, while you chop it, dredge it lightly with a little flour.</p>

<p>Beef-marrow is excellent for most of the purposes for which suet is
employed.</p>

<p>Drippings, especially from beef, when very clean and nice, are
frequently used for kitchen crusts and pies, and for such purposes are a
satisfactory substitute for butter, lard, &amp;c. To clean and preserve
drippings, see <a href="#ap_no_83">No. 83</a>.</p>

<p>Currants, previous to putting them into the pudding, should be plumped:
this is done by pouring some boiling water upon them: wash them well,
and then lay them on a sieve or cloth before the fire, pick them clean
from the stones;&mdash;this not only makes them look better, but cleanses
them from all dirt.</p>

<p>Raisins, figs, dried cherries, candied orange and lemon-peel, citron,
and preserves of all kinds, fresh fruits, gooseberries, currants, plums,
damsons, &amp;c. are added to batter and suet puddings, or enclosed in the
crust ordered for apple dumplings, and make all the various puddings
called by those names.</p>

<p>Batter puddings must be quite smooth and free from lumps; to ensure
this, first mix the flour with a little milk, add the remainder by
degrees, and then the other ingredients.</p>

<p>If it is a plain pudding, put it through a hair-sieve; this will take
out all lumps effectually.</p>

<p>Batter puddings should be tied up tight: if boiled in a mould, butter it
first; if baked, also butter the pan.</p>

<p>Be sure the water boils before you put in the pudding; set your stew-pan
on a trivet over the fire, and keep it steadily boiling all the
time;&mdash;if set upon the fire, the pudding often burns.</p>

<p>Be scrupulously careful that your pudding-cloth is perfectly sweet and
clean; wash it without any soap, unless very greasy; then rinse it
thoroughly in clean water after. Im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>mediately before you use it, dip it
in boiling water; squeeze it dry, and dredge it with flour.</p>

<p>If your fire is very fierce, mind and stir the puddings every now and
then to keep them from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan; if in a
mould, this care is not so much required, but keep plenty of water in
the saucepan.</p>

<p>When puddings are boiled in a cloth, it should be just dipped in a basin
of cold water, before you untie the pudding-cloth, as that will prevent
it from sticking; but when boiled in a mould, if it is well buttered,
they will turn out without. Custard or bread puddings require to stand
five minutes before they are turned out. They should always be boiled in
a mould or cups.</p>

<p>Keep your paste-board, rolling-pin, cutters, and tins very clean: the
least dust on the tins and cutters, or the least hard paste on the
rolling-pin, will spoil the whole of your labour.</p>

<p>Things used for pastry or cakes should not be used for any other
purpose; be very careful that your flour is dried at the fire before you
use it, for puff paste or cakes; if damp it will make them heavy.</p>

<p>In using butter for puff paste, you should take the greatest care to
previously work it well on the paste-board or slab, to get out all the
water and buttermilk, which very often remains in; when you have worked
it well with a clean knife, dab it over with a soft cloth, and it is
then ready to lay on your paste; do not make your paste over stiff
before you put in your butter.</p>

<p>For those who do not understand making puff paste, it is by far the best
way to work the butter in at two separate times, divide it in half, and
break the half in little bits, and cover your paste all over: dredge it
lightly with flour, then fold it over each side and ends, roll it out
quite thin, and then put in the rest of the butter, fold it, and roll it
again. Remember always to roll puff paste from you. The best made paste,
if not properly baked, will not do the cook any credit.</p>

<p>Those who use iron ovens do not always succeed in baking puff paste,
fruit pies, &amp;c. Puff paste is often spoiled by baking it after fruit
pies, in an iron oven. This may be easily avoided, by putting two or
three bricks that are quite even into the oven before it is first set to
get hot. This will not only prevent the syrup from boiling put of the
pies, but also prevent a very disagreeable smell in the kitchen and
house, and almost answers the same purpose as a brick oven.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>College Puddings.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_105" id="ap_no_105"></a>No. 105.)</h3>

<p>Beat four eggs, yelks and whites together, in a quart basin, with two
ounces of flour, half a nutmeg, a little ginger, and three ounces of
sugar; pounded loaf sugar is best. Beat it into a smooth batter; then
add six ounces of suet, chopped fine, six of currants, well washed and
picked; mix it all well together; a glass of brandy or white wine will
improve it. These puddings are generally fried in butter or lard; but
they are much nicer baked in an oven in patty-pans; twenty minutes will
bake them: if fried, fry them till they are of a nice light brown, and
when fried, roll them in a little flour. You may add one ounce of orange
or citron, minced very fine; when you bake them, add one more egg, or
two spoonfuls of milk. Serve them up with white wine sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Rice Puddings baked, or boiled.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_106" id="ap_no_106"></a>No. 106.)</h3>

<p>Wash in cold water and pick very clean six ounces of rice, put it in a
quart stew-pan three parts filled with cold water, set it on the fire,
and let it boil five minutes; pour away the water, and put in one quart
of milk, a roll of lemon peel, and a bit of cinnamon; let it boil gently
till the rice is quite tender; it will take at least one hour and a
quarter; be careful to stir it every five minutes; take it off the fire,
and stir in an ounce and a half of fresh butter, and beat up three eggs
on a plate, a salt-spoonful of nutmeg, two ounces of sugar; put it into
the pudding, and stir it till it is quite smooth; line a pie-dish big
enough to hold it with puff paste, notch it round the edge, put in your
pudding, and bake it three quarters of an hour: this will be a nice firm
pudding.</p>

<p>If you like it to eat more like custard, add one more egg, and half a
pint more milk; it will be better a little thinner when boiled; one hour
will boil it. If you like it in little puddings, butter small tea-cups,
and either bake or boil them, half an hour will do either: you may vary
the pudding by putting in candied lemon or orange-peel, minced very
fine, or dried cherries, or three ounces of currants, or raisins, or
apples minced fine.</p>

<p>If the puddings are baked or boiled, serve them with white-wine sauce,
or butter and sugar.</p>

bit of cinnamon; keep stirring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span> it till it boils; beat it to a smooth
batter; then set it on the trivet, where it will simmer gently for a
quarter of an hour; then beat three eggs on a plate, stir them into the
pudding with two ounces of sugar and two drachms of nutmeg, take out the
lemon-peel and cinnamon, stir it all well together, line a pie-dish with
thin puff paste (<a href="#ap_no_1">No. 1</a> of receipts for pastry), big enough to hold it,
or butter the dish well, and bake it half an hour; if boiled, it will
take one hour in a mould well buttered; three ounces of currants may be
added.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Rice Snow Balls.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_108" id="ap_no_108"></a>No. 108.)</h3>

<p>Wash and pick half a pound of rice very clean, put it on in a saucepan
with plenty of water; when it boils let it boil ten minutes, drain it on
a sieve till it is quite dry, and then pare six apples, weighing two
ounces and a half each. Divide the rice into six parcels, in separate
cloths, put one apple in each, tie it loose, and boil it one hour; serve

<p>Put a tea-cupful of whole rice into the least water possible, till it
almost bursts; then add half a pint of good milk or thin cream, and boil
it till it is quite a mash, stirring it the whole time it is on the
fire, that it may not burn; dip a shape in cold water, and do not dry
it; put in the rice, and let it stand until quite cold, when it will
come easily out of the shape. This dish is much approved of; it is eaten
with cream or custard, and preserved fruits; raspberries are best. It
should be made the day before it is wanted, that it may get firm.</p>

<p>This blancmange will eat much nicer, flavoured with spices, lemon-peel,
&amp;c., and sweetened with a little loaf sugar, add it with the milk, and
take out the lemon-peel before you put in the mould.</p>

pudding in, and tie it tight over with a pudding-cloth, and boil it one
hour and a quarter. Or, put it in a dish that you have well buttered,
and bake it three quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Currants washed and picked clean, or raisins stoned, are good in this
pudding, and it is then called a black cap: or, add loaf sugar, and a
little nutmeg and ginger without the fruit,&mdash;it is very good that way;
serve it with wine sauce.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Apple Pudding boiled.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_112" id="ap_no_112"></a>No. 112.)</h3>

<p>Chop four ounces of beef suet very fine, or two ounces of butter, lard,
or dripping; but the suet makes the best and lightest crust; put it on
the paste-board, with eight ounces of flour, and a salt-spoonful of
salt, mix it well together with your hands, and then put it all of a
heap, and make a hole in the middle; break one egg in it, stir it well
together with your finger, and by degrees infuse as much water as will
make it of a stiff paste: roll it out two or three times, with the
rolling-pin, and then roll it large enough to receive thirteen ounces of
apples. It will look neater if boiled in a basin, well buttered, than
when boiled in a pudding-cloth, well floured; boil it an hour and three
quarters: but the surest way is to stew the apples first in a stew-pan,
with a wine-glassful of water, and then one hour will boil it. Some
people like it flavoured with cloves and lemon-peel, and sweeten it with
two ounces of sugar.</p>

<p>Gooseberries, currants, raspberries, and cherries, damsons, and various
plums and fruits, are made into puddings with the same crust directed
for apple puddings.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Apple Dumplings.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_113" id="ap_no_113"></a>No. 113.)</h3>

<p>Make paste the same as for apple pudding, divide it into as many pieces
as you want dumplings, peel the apples and core them, then roll out your
paste large enough, and put in the apples; close it all round, and tie
them in pudding-cloths very tight; one hour will boil them: and when you
take them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span> up, just dip them in cold water, and put them in a cup the
size of the dumpling while you untie them, and they will turn out
without breaking.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Suet Pudding or Dumplings.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_114" id="ap_no_114"></a>No. 114.)</h3>

<p>Chop six ounces of suet very fine: put it in a basin with six ounces of
flour, two ounces of bread-crumbs, and a tea-spoonful of salt; stir it
all well together: beat two eggs on a plate, add to them six
table-spoonfuls of milk, put it by degrees into the basin, and stir it
all well together; divide it into six dumplings, and tie them separate,
previously dredging the cloth lightly with flour. Boil them one hour.</p>

<p>This is very good the next day fried in a little butter. The above will
make a good pudding, boiled in an earthenware mould, with the addition
of one more egg, a little more milk, and two ounces of suet. Boil it two
hours.</p>

<p><a name="nb-ap-114" id="nb-ap-114"></a>N.B. The most economical way of making suet dumplings, is to boil them
without a cloth in a pot with beef or mutton; no eggs are then wanted,
and the dumplings are quite as light without: roll them in flour before
you put them into the pot; add six ounces of currants, washed and
picked, and you have currant pudding: or divided into six parts, currant
dumplings; a little sugar will improve them.</p>

a smooth batter, with about three quarters of a pint of milk, two ounces
of moist sugar, and two or three beaten eggs. Bake it about three
quarters of an hour. Three ounces of currants or raisins may be added.
Leave out the milk, and add three ounces of butter,&mdash;it will make a very

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="OBSERVATIONS_ON_PICKLES" id="OBSERVATIONS_ON_PICKLES"></a>OBSERVATIONS ON PICKLES.</h3>

<p>We are not fond of pickles: these sponges of vinegar are often very
indigestible, especially in the crisp state in which they are most
admired. The Indian fashion of pounding pickles is an excellent one: we
recommend those who have any regard for their stomach, yet still wish to
indulge their tongue, instead of eating pickles, which are really
merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span> vehicles for taking a certain portion of vinegar and spice, &amp;c.
to use the flavoured vinegars; such as burnet (<a href="#no_399">No. 399</a>), horseradish
(<a href="#no_399-1">No. 399*</a>), tarragon (<a href="#no_396">No. 396</a>), mint (<a href="#no_397">No. 397</a>), cress (Nos. <a href="#no_397-1">397*</a>, <a href="#no_401">401</a>,
<a href="#no_403">403</a>, <a href="#no_405-1">405*</a>, <a href="#no_453">453</a>, <a href="#no_457">457</a>), &amp;c.; by combinations of these, a relish may easily
be composed, exactly in harmony with the palate of the eater.</p>

<p>The pickle made to preserve cucumbers, &amp;c. is generally so strongly
impregnated with garlic, mustard, and spice, &amp;c. that the original
flavour of the vegetables is quite overpowered; and if the eater shuts
his eyes, his lingual nerves will be puzzled to inform him whether he is
munching an onion or a cucumber, &amp;c., and nothing can be more absurd,
than to pickle plums, peaches, apricots, currants, grapes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The strongest vinegar must be used for pickling: it must not be boiled
or the strength of the vinegar and spices will be evaporated. By
parboiling the pickles in brine, they will be ready in much less time
than they are when done in the usual manner, of soaking them in cold
salt and water for six or eight days. When taken out of the hot brine,
let them get cold and quite dry before you put them into the pickle.</p>

<p>To assist the preservation of pickles, a portion of salt is added; and
for the same purpose, and to give flavour, long pepper, black pepper,
allspice, ginger, cloves, mace, garlic, eschalots, mustard, horseradish,
and capsicum.</p>

<p>The following is the best method of preparing the pickle, as cheap as
any, and requires less care than any other way.</p>

<p>Bruise in a mortar four ounces of the above spices; put them into a
stone jar with a quart of the strongest vinegar, stop the jar closely
with a bung, cover that with a bladder soaked with pickle, set it on a
trivet by the side of the fire for three days, well shaking it up at
least three times in the day; the pickle should be at least three inches
above the pickles. The jar being well closed, and the infusion being
made with a mild heat, there is no loss by evaporation.</p>

<p>To enable the articles pickled more easily and speedily to imbibe the
flavour of the pickle they are immersed in, previously to pouring it on
them, run a larding-pin through them in several places.</p>

<p>The spices, &amp;c. commonly used, are those mentioned in the receipt for
pickling walnuts; which is also an excellent savoury sauce for cold
meats.</p>

<p>The flavour may be varied <i>ad infinitum</i> by adding celery, cress-seed,
or curry powder (<a href="#no_455">No. 455</a>), or by taking for the liquor any of the
flavoured vinegars, &amp;c. we have enumerated above, and see the receipts
between Nos. <a href="#no_395">395</a> and <a href="#no_421">421</a>.</p>

<p>Pickles should be kept in a dry place, in unglazed earthen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>ware, or
glass jars, which are preferable, as you can, without opening them,
observe whether they want filling up: they must be very carefully
stopped with well-fitted bungs, and tied over as closely as possible
with a bladder wetted with the pickle; and if to be preserved a long
time, after that is dry, it must be dipped in bottle-cement; see <a href="#Page_127">page
127</a>.</p>

<p>When the pickles are all used, boil up the liquor with a little fresh
spice.</p>

<p>To walnut liquor may be added a few anchovies and eschalots: let it
stand till it is quite clear, and bottle it: thus you may furnish your
table with an excellent savoury keeping sauce for hashes, made dishes,
fish, &amp;c. at very small cost; see <a href="#no_439">No. 439</a>.</p>

<p>Jars should not be more than three parts filled with the articles
pickled, which should be covered with pickle at least two inches above
their surface; the liquor wastes, and all of the articles pickled, that
are not covered, are soon spoiled.</p>

<p>When they have been done about a week, open the jars, and fill them up
with pickle.</p>

<p>Tie a wooden spoon, full of holes, round each jar to take them out with.</p>

<p>If you wish to have gherkins, &amp;c. very green, this may be easily
accomplished by keeping them in vinegar, sufficiently hot, till they
become so.</p>

<p>If you wish cauliflowers, onions, &amp;c. to be white, use distilled vinegar
for them.</p>

<p>To entirely prevent the mischief arising from the action of the acid
upon the metallic utensils usually employed to prepare pickles, the
whole of the process is directed to be performed in unglazed stone jars.</p>

<p><a name="nb-p-400" id="nb-p-400"></a>N.B. The maxim of &#8220;open your mouth, and shut your eyes,&#8221; cannot be
better applied than to pickles; and the only direction we have to record
for the improvement of their complexion, is the joke of Dr. Goldsmith,
&#8220;If their colour does not please you, send &#8217;em to Hammersmith, that&#8217;s
the way to Turnham Green.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commencing the list with walnuts, I must take this opportunity of
impressing the necessity of being strictly particular in watching the
due season; for of all the variety of articles in this department to
furnish the well-regulated store-room, nothing is so precarious, for
frequently after the first week that walnuts come in season, they become
hard and shelled, particularly if the season is a very hot one;
therefore let the prudent housekeeper consider it indispensably
necessary they should be purchased as soon as they first appear at
market; should they cost a trifle more, that is nothing com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>pared to the
disappointment of finding, six months hence, when you go to your
pickle-jar, expecting a fine relish for your chops, &amp;c. to find the nuts
incased in a shell, which defies both teeth and steel.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Walnuts.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_116" id="ap_no_116"></a>No. 116.)</h3>

<p>Make a brine of salt and water, in the proportion of a quarter of a
pound of salt to a quart of water; put the walnuts into this to soak for
a week; or if you wish to soften them so that they may be soon ready for
eating, run a larding-pin through them in half a dozen places&mdash;this will
allow the pickle to penetrate, and they will be much softer, and of
better flavour, and ready much sooner than if not perforated: put them
into a stew-pan with such brine, and give them a gentle simmer; put them
on a sieve to drain; then lay them on a fish plate, and let them stand
in the air till they turn black&mdash;this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span> may take a couple of days; put
them into glass, or unglazed stone jars; fill these about three parts
with the walnuts, and fill them up with the following pickle.</p>

<p>To each quart of the strongest vinegar put two ounces of black pepper,
one of ginger, same of eschalots, same of salt, half an ounce of
allspice, and half a drachm of Cayenne. Put these into a stone jar;
cover it with a bladder, wetted with pickle, tie over that some leather,
and set the jar on a trivet by the side of the fire for three days,
shaking it up three times a day, and then pour it while hot to the
walnuts, and cover them down with bladder wetted with the pickle,
leather, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Gherkins.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_117" id="ap_no_117"></a>No. 117.)</h3>

<p>Get those of about four inches long, and an inch in diameter, the crude
half-grown little gherkins usually pickled are good for nothing. Put
them into (unglazed) stone pans; cover them with a brine of salt and
water, made with a quarter of a pound of salt to a quart of water; cover
them down; set them on the earth before the fire for two or three days
till they begin to turn yellow; then put away the water, and cover them
with hot vinegar; set them again before the fire; keep them hot till
they become green (this will take eight or ten days); then pour off the
vinegar, having ready to cover them a pickle of fresh vinegar, &amp;c., the
same as directed in the preceding receipt for walnuts (leaving out the
eschalots); cover them with a bung, bladder, and leather. Read the
observations on pickles, p. 487.</p>

<p><a name="obs-ap-117" id="obs-ap-117"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;The vinegar the gherkins were greened in will make excellent
salad sauce, or for cold meats. It is, in fact, superlative cucumber
vinegar.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>French Beans&mdash;Nasturtiums, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_118" id="ap_no_118"></a>No. 118.)</h3>

<p>When young, and most other small green vegetables, may be pickled the
same way as gherkins.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Beet Roots.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_119" id="ap_no_119"></a>No. 119.)</h3>

<p>Boil gently till they are full three parts done (this will take from an
hour and a half to two and a half); then take them out, and when a
little cooled, peel them, and cut them in slices about half an inch
thick. Have ready a pickle for it, made by adding to each a quart of
vinegar an ounce of ground black pepper, half an ounce of ginger
pounded, same of salt, and of horseradish cut in thin slices; and you
may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span> warm it, if you like, with a few capsicums, or a little Cayenne;
put these ingredients into a jar; stop it close, and let them steep
three days on a trivet by the side of the fire; then, when cold, pour
the clear liquor on the beet-root, which have previously arranged in a
jar.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Red Cabbage.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_120" id="ap_no_120"></a>No. 120.)</h3>

<p>Get a fine purple cabbage, take off the outside leaves, quarter it, take
out the stalk, shred the leaves into a colander, sprinkle them with
salt, let them remain till the morrow, drain them dry, put them into a
jar, and cover them with the pickle for beet roots.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Onions.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_121" id="ap_no_121"></a>No. 121.)</h3>

<p>The small round silver button onions, about as big as a nutmeg, make a
very nice pickle. Take off their top coats, have ready a stew-pan, three
parts filled with boiling water, into which put as many onions as will
cover the top: as soon as they look clear, immediately take them up with
a spoon full of holes, and lay them on a cloth three times folded, and
cover them with another till you have ready as many as you wish: when
they are quite dry, put them into jars, and cover them with hot pickle,
made by infusing an ounce of horseradish, same of allspice, and same of
black pepper, and same of salt, in a quart of best white-wine vinegar,
in a stone jar, on a trivet by the side of the fire for three days,
keeping it well closed; when cold, bung them down tight, and cover them
with bladder wetted with the pickle and leather.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Cauliflowers or Broccoli.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_122" id="ap_no_122"></a>No. 122.)</h3>

<p>Choose those that are hard, yet sufficiently ripe, cut away the leaves
and stalks.</p>

<p>Set on a stew-pan half full of water, salted in proportion of a quarter
of a pound of salt to a quart of water; throw in the cauliflower, and
let it heat gradually; when it boils take it up with a spoon full of
holes, and spread them on a cloth to dry before the fire, for
twenty-four hours at least; when quite dry, put them, piece by piece,
into jars or glass tie-overs, and cover them with the pickle we have
directed for beet roots, or make a pickle by infusing three ounces of
the curry powder (<a href="#no_455">No. 455</a>) for three days in a quart of vinegar by the
side of the fire.</p>

<p>Nasturtiums are excellent prepared as above.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Indian or mixed Pickles&mdash;Mango or Piccalilli.</i>&mdash;(<a name="ap_no_123" id="ap_no_123"></a>No. 123.)</h3>

<p>The flavouring ingredients of Indian pickles are a compound of curry
powder, with a large proportion of mustard and garlic.</p>

<p>The following will be found something like the real mango pickle,
especially if the garlic be used plentifully. To each gallon of the
strongest vinegar put four ounces of curry powder (<a href="#no_455">No. 455</a>), same of
flour of mustard (some rub these together, with half a pint of salad
oil), three of ginger bruised, and two of turmeric, half a pound (when
skinned) of eschalots slightly baked in a Dutch oven, two ounces of
garlic prepared in like manner, a quarter of a pound of salt, and two
drachms of Cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>Put these ingredients into a stone jar; cover it with a bladder wetted
with the pickle, and set it on a trivet by the side of the fire during
three days, shaking it up three times a day; it will then be ready to
receive gherkins, sliced cucumbers, sliced onions, button onions,
cauliflowers, celery, broccoli, French beans, nasturtiums, capsicums,
and small green melons. The latter must be slit in the middle
sufficiently to admit a marrow-spoon, with which take out all the seeds;
then parboil the melons in a brine that will bear an egg; dry them, and
fill them with mustard-seed, and two cloves of garlic, and bind the
melon round with packthread.</p>

<p>Large cucumbers may be prepared in like manner.</p>

<p>Green peaches make the best imitation of the Indian mango.</p>

<p>The other articles are to be separately parboiled (excepting the
capsicums) in a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg;
taken out and drained, and spread out, and thoroughly dried in the sun,
on a stove, or before a fire, for a couple of days, and then put into
the pickle.</p>

<p>Any thing may be put into this pickle, except red cabbage and walnuts.</p>

<p>It will keep several years.</p>

<p><a name="obs-ap-123" id="obs-ap-123"></a><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;To the Indian mango pickle is added a considerable quantity of
mustard-seed oil, which would also be an excellent warm ingredient in

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;Take care that your plate is quite free from grease.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;Take some whitening mixed with water, and a sponge, rub it
well on the plate, which will take the tarnish off; if it is very bad,
repeat the whitening and water several times, making use of a brush, not
too hard, to clean the intricate parts.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;Take some rouge-powder, mix it with water to about the
thickness of cream, and with a small piece of leather (which should be
kept for that purpose only) apply the rouge, which, with the addition of
a little &#8220;Elbow Grease,&#8221; will, in a short time, produce a most beautiful

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Varnish for Oil Paintings.</i></h3>

<p>According to the number of your pictures, take the whites<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span> of the same
number of eggs, and an equal number of pieces of sugar candy, the size

beat the whites of your eggs to a froth, and let it settle; take the

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Method of cleaning Paper-Hangings.</i></h3>

<p>Cut into eight half quarters a quartern loaf, two days old; it must
neither be newer nor staler. With one of these pieces, after having
blown off all the dust from the paper to be cleaned, by the means of a
good pair of bellows, begin at the top of the room, holding the crust in
the hand, and wiping lightly downward with the crumb, about half a yard
at each stroke, till the upper part of the hangings is completely
cleaned all round. Then go round again, with the like sweeping stroke
downwards, always commencing each successive course a little higher than
the upper stroke had extended, till the bottom be finished. This
operation, if carefully performed, will frequently make very old paper
look almost equal to new.</p>

<p>Great caution must be used not by any means to rub the paper hard, nor
to attempt cleaning it the cross, or horizontal way. The dirty part of
the bread, too, must be each time cut away, and the pieces renewed as
soon as it may become necessary.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>To make</i> <span class="smcap">Wooden</span> <i>Stairs have the appearance of</i> <span class="smcap">Stone</span>.</h3>

<p>Paint the stairs, step by step, with white paint, mixed with strong
drying oil. Strew it thick with silver sand.</p>

<p>It ought to be thoroughly dry next morning, when the loose sand is to be
swept off. The painting and sanding is to be repeated, and when dry, the
surface is to be done over with pipe-clay, whiting, and water; which may
be boiled in an old saucepan, and laid on with a bit of flannel, not too

<p>A penny cake of pipe-clay, which must be scraped, is the common

<h3 class="recipe"><i>French Polish.</i></h3>

<p>Take a quarter of an ounce of gum sandarac and a quarter of an ounce of
gum mastic; pick the dirt and black lumps out very carefully, and pound
them in a mortar quite fine; put them into a bottle, and add to them a
quartern (old measure) of strong spirit of wine; cork it down and put it
in a warm place; shake it frequently till the gum is entirely dissolved,
which will be in about twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Before using it, be careful to ascertain that no <i>grease</i> is on the
furniture, as <i>grease</i> would prevent its receiving the polish. If the
furniture has been previously cleaned with bees&#8217;-wax or oil, it must be
got off by scraping, which is the best way, but difficult to those who
do not perfectly understand it, because if you are not very careful, you
may scratch the surface, and create more expense than a workman would
charge to do it properly at first. Or it may be done by scouring well
with sand and water, and afterward rubbed quite smooth with fine glass
paper, being careful to do it with the grain of the wood. To apply the
polish, you must have a piece of list or cloth twisted, and tied round
quite tight, and left even at one end, which should be covered with a
piece of fine linen cloth; then pour a little of the polish on the
furniture, and rub it well all over till it is worked into the grain of
the wood, and begins to look quite smooth; then take a soft fine cloth,
or what is better, an old silk handkerchief, and keep rubbing lightly
until the polish is complete, which will take two or three hours. It
will greatly help the polish if it is done near a fire.</p>

<p>If it does not look so smooth and clear as it should, a little sweet oil
rubbed lightly over, and cleaned off directly, will greatly heighten it.
If any part of the furniture has carving about it, where it will be
impossible to polish, it must be done with mastic varnish, and a camel&#8217;s
hair brush, after the rest is finished.</p>

<p>When the polish begins to look dull, it may be recovered with a little
spirit of wine.</p>

unattainable by any other means, and equal to the finest French polish;
and if the table is covered with the tablecloth only, the hottest dishes
will make no impression upon it: and when once this polish is produced,
it will only require dry rubbing with a linen cloth for about ten
minutes twice in a week, to preserve it in the highest perfection; which
never fails to please your employers; and remember, that to please
others is always the surest way to profit yourself.</p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>To prevent disagreeable Smells from Sinks, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<p>The disgustful effluvia arising from cabbage-water, and the various
ungrateful odours which arise from the sink of kitchens, drains, &amp;c.,
are not only an unnecessary nuisance to the good folks of the second
table, but we believe such miasm is not an uncommon cause of putrid
fevers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>It cannot be too generally known, that a cheap and simple apparatus has
been contrived for carrying off the waste water, &amp;c. from sinks, which
at the same time effectually prevents any air returning back from
thence, or from any drain connected therewith. This is known by the name
of Stink Trap, and costs about five shillings.</p>

<p>No kitchen sink should be without it.</p>

<p>When the furs are wanted for use, beat them well as before, and expose
them for twenty-four hours to the air, which will take away the smell of
the camphor.</p>

<p>If the fur has long hair, as bear or fox, add to the camphor an equal
quantity of black pepper in powder.</p>


<h3 class="recipe"><i>Paste.</i></h3>

<h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="OBSERVATIONS_ON_CARVING" id="OBSERVATIONS_ON_CARVING"></a>OBSERVATIONS ON CARVING.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;&#8216;Have you learned to carve?&#8217; for it is ridiculous not to carve
well.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man who tells you gravely that he cannot carve, may as well tell
you that he cannot feed himself; it is both as necessary and as
easy.&#8221;&mdash;Lord <span class="smcap">Chesterfield&#8217;s</span> <i>211th Letter</i>.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> to giving a good dinner, is treating our friends with hospitality
and attention, and this attention is what young people have to learn.
Experience will teach them in time, but till they acquire it, they will
appear ungraceful and awkward.</p>

<p>Although the <i>art of carving</i> is one of the most necessary
accomplishments of a gentleman, it is little known but to those who have
long been accustomed to it; a more useful or acceptable present cannot
be offered to the public than to lay before them a book calculated to
teach the rising generation how to acquit themselves amiably in this
material part of the duties of the table.</p>

<p>Young people seldom study this branch of the philosophy of the banquet,
beyond the suggestion of their own whims and caprices; and cut up things
not only carelessly, but wastefully, until they learn the pleasure of
paying butchers&#8217; and poulterers&#8217; bills on their own account.</p>

<p>Young housekeepers, unaccustomed to carving, will, with the help of the
following instructions, soon be enabled to carve with ease and elegance;
taking care also to observe, as occasion may offer, the manner in which
a skilful operator sets about his task, when a joint or fowl is placed
before him.</p>

<p>It has been said, that you may judge of a person&#8217;s character by his
handwriting; you may judge of his conscience by his carving.</p>

<p>Fair carving is much more estimable evidence of good nature than fair
writing: let me see how a gentleman carves at another person&#8217;s table,
especially how he helps himself, and I will presently tell you how far
he is of Pope&#8217;s opinion, that</p>

<p class="titlepage">&#8220;True self-love and social are the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>The selfish appetites never exhibit themselves in a more unmasked and
more disgusting manner than in the use they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span> excite a man to make of his
knife and fork in carving for himself, especially when not at his own
cost.</p>

<p>Some keen observer of human nature has said, &#8220;Would you know a man&#8217;s
real disposition, ask him to dinner, and give him plenty to drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Oracle&#8221; says, &#8220;invite the gentleman to dinner, certainly, and set
him to carving.&#8221; The gentleman who wishes to ensure a hearty welcome,
and frequent invitations to the board of hospitality, may calculate with
Cockerial correctness, that &#8220;the easier he appears to be pleased, the
oftener he will be invited.&#8221; Instead of unblushingly demanding of the
fair hostess, that the prime &#8220;tit-bit of every dish be put on his plate,
he must receive, (if not with pleasure or even content,) with the
liveliest expressions of thankfulness, whatever is presented to him; and
let him not forget to praise the cook (no matter whether he be pleased
with her performance or not), and the same shall be reckoned unto him
even as praise to the mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does not like his fare, he may console himself with the
reflection, that he need not expose his mouth to the like mortification
again. Mercy to the feelings of the mistress of the mansion, will forbid
his then appearing otherwise than absolutely delighted with it,
notwithstanding it may be his extreme antipathy. If he like it ever so
little, he will find occasion to congratulate himself on the advantage
his digestive organs will derive from his making a moderate dinner; and
consolation from contemplating the double relish he is creating for the
following meal, and anticipating the rare and delicious zest of (that
best sauce) good appetite, and an unrestrained indulgence of his
gourmandizing fancies at the chop-house he frequents.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following extract from that rare book, <span class="smcap">Giles Rose&#8217;s</span> <i>School for the
Officers of the Mouth</i>, 16mo. 1684, shows that the art of carving was a
much more elaborate affair formerly than it is at present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Le grand escuver tranchant</span>, <i>or the Great Master Carver</i>. &#8220;The exercise
of a master carver is more noble and commendable, it may be, than every
one will imagine; for suppose that life to be the foundation of all that
is done in the world, this life is not to be sustained without
maintaining our natural heat by eating and drinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never trust a cook teaser with the important office of carver, or place
him within reach of any principal dish. I shall never forget the
following exhibition of a selfish spoiled child: the first dish that
Master Johnny mangled, was three mackerel; he cut off the upper side of
each fish: next came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span> a couple of fowls; in taking off the wings of
which the young gentleman so hideously hacked and miserably mangled
every other part, that when they were brought for luncheon the following
day, they appeared as if just removed from a conclave of dainty cats,
rather than having been carved by a rational creature. When the master
of the family, who was extremely near-sighted, sat down to his nooning,
in expectation of enjoying the agreeable amusement of having a</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Nice bit of chicken<br />
For his own private <a name="corr95" id="corr95"></a>picking,&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">no sooner had he put on his specs, and begun to focus his fowl, than he
suddenly started up, rang for the cook, and after having vociferated at
her carelessness, and lectured her for being so extremely perfunctory
and disorderly in not keeping the cat out of the cupboard, till his
appetite for scolding was pretty well satisfied, he paused for her
apology: the guardian genius of the pantry, to his extreme astonishment,
informed him, that his suspicions concerning the hideous appearance
which had so shocked him, was erroneous: such unsightly havoc was not
occasioned by the epicurism of a <i>four</i>-legged brute, and that the fowls
were exactly in the same state they came from the table, and that young
Master Johnny had cut them up himself.</p>

<p>Those in the parlour should recollect the importance of setting a good
example to their friends at the second table. If they cut bread, meat,
cheese, &amp;c. fairly, it will go twice as far as if hacked and mangled by
some sensualists, who appear to have less consideration for their
domestics than a good sportsman for his dogs.</p>

<p>A prudent carver will distribute the dainties he is serving out in equal
division, and regulate his helps by the proportion his dish bears to the
number it is to be divided among, and considering the quantum of
appetite the several guests are presumed to possess.</p>

<p>If you have a bird, or other delicacy at table, which cannot be
apportioned out to all as you wish, when cut up, let it be handed round
by a servant; modesty will then prompt the guests to take but a small
portion, and such as perhaps could not be offered to them without
disrespect.</p>

<p>Those chop-house cormorants who</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Critique your wine, and analyze your meat,<br />
Yet on plain pudding deign at home to eat,&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">are generally tremendously officious in serving out the loaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span> and
fishes of other people; for, under the notion of appearing exquisitely
amiable, and killingly agreeable to the guests, they are ever on the
watch to distribute themselves the dainties<a name="FNanchor_412-1_254" id="FNanchor_412-1_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_412-1_254" class="fnanchor">412-*</a> which it is the
peculiar part of the master and mistress to serve out, and is to them
the most pleasant part of the business of the banquet; the pleasure of
helping their friends is the gratification which is their reward for the
trouble they have had in preparing the feast: such gentry are the terror
of all good housewives; to obtain their favourite cut they will so
unmercifully mangle your joints, that a lady&#8217;s dainty lapdog would
hardly get a meal from them afterward; but which, if managed by the
considerative hands of an old housekeeper, would furnish a decent dinner
for a large family.</p>

<p>The man of manners picks not the best, but rather takes the worst out of
the dish, and gets of every thing (unless it be forced upon him) always
the most indifferent fare by this civility, the best remains for others;
which being a compliment to all that are present, every body will be
pleased with it; the more they love themselves, the more they are forced
to approve of his behaviour, and gratitude stepping in, they are
obliged, almost whether they will or not, to think favourably of him.</p>

<p>After this manner it is that the well-bred man insinuates himself in the
esteem of all the companies he comes in; and if he gets nothing else by
it, the pleasure he receives in reflecting on the applause which he
knows is secretly given him, is to a proud man more than equivalent for
his former self-denial, and overpays self-love, with interest, the loss
it sustained in his complaisance to others.</p>

<p>If there are seven or eight apples, or peaches, among people of
ceremony, that are pretty nearly equal, he who is prevailed on to choose
first, will take that which, if there be any considerable difference, a
child would know to be the worst.</p>

<p>This he does to insinuate, that he looks upon those he is with to be of
superior merit; and that there is not one whom he does not love better
than himself. Custom and general practice make this modish deceit
familiar to us, without being shocked at the absurdity of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;If people had been used to speak from the sincerity of their hearts,
and act according to the natural sentiments they felt within, till they
were three or four and forty, it would be impossible for them to assist
at this comedy of manners without either loud laughter or indigestion;
and yet it is cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>tain, that such a behaviour makes us more tolerable to
one another, than we could be otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master or mistress of the table should appear to continue eating as
long as any of the company; and should, accordingly, help themselves in
a way that will enable them to give this specimen of good manners
without being particularly observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It belongs to the master and mistress, and to no one else, to desire
their guests to eat, and, indeed, carving belongs to nobody but the
master and mistress, and those whom they think fit to desire, who are to
deliver what they cut to the master or mistress, to be by them
distributed at their pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>A seat should be placed for the carver sufficiently elevated to give him
a command of the table, as the act of rising to perform this duty is
considered ungraceful.</p>

<p>The carving-knife should be light and sharp; and it should be firmly
grasped; although in using it, strength is not as essential as skill,
particularly if the butcher has properly divided the bones of such
joints as the neck, loin, and breast of veal or of mutton.</p>

<p>The dish should not be far from the carver; for when it is too distant,
by occasioning the arms to be too much extended, it gives an awkward
appearance to the person, and renders the task more difficult.</p>

<p>In carving fish, care should be taken not to break the flakes, and this
is best avoided by the use of a fish trowel, which not being sharp,
divides it better than a steel knife. Examine this little drawing, and
you will see how a cod&#8217;s head and shoulders should be carved. The head
and shoulders of a cod contain the richest and best part of this
excellent fish.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>The first piece may be taken off in the direction of <i>a b</i>, by putting
in the trowel at the back or thick part of the fish, and the rest in
successive order. A small part of the sound should be given with each
slice, and will be found close to the back-bone, by raising the thin
flap <i>d</i>. It is known by being darker coloured and more transparent than
the other parts of the fish. Almost every part of a cod&#8217;s head is
considered good; the palate, the tongue, the jelly, and firm parts, <i>e

considered as delicate eating by many persons.</p>

</div>


<p>A boiled fowl has the legs bent inward (see <a href="#fig02"><i>fig. 2</i></a>), and fastened to
the sides by a skewer, which is removed before the fowl is sent to
table. A roasted fowl should not have any part of the legs cut off, as
in the boiled fowl; but after they have been properly scraped and
washed, they are drawn together at the very extremity of the breast. A
boiled and a roasted fowl are each carved in the same manner. The wings
are taken off in the direction of <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> (<a href="#fig02"><i>fig. 2</i></a>). Your knife must
divide the joint, but afterward you have only to take firm hold of the
pinion with your fork, draw the wings towards the legs, and you will
find that the muscles separate better than if you cut them with your
knife. Slip your knife between the leg and the body, and cut to the
bone, then with the fork turn the leg back, and, if the fowl be not a
very old one, the joints will give way.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 178px;">

</div>

<p>After the four quarters are thus removed, enter the knife at the breast,
in the direction <i>c d</i> <a name="corr96" id="corr96"></a>(<a href="#fig03"><i>fig. 3</i></a>), and you will separate the
merrythought from the breast-bone; and by placing your knife under it,
lift it up, pressing it backward on the dish, and you will easily remove
that bone. The collar-bones, <i>e e</i>, lie on each side the merrythought,
and are to be lifted up at the broad end, by the knife, and forced
towards the breast-bone, till the part which is fastened to it breaks
off. The breast is next to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span> separated from the carcass, by cutting
through the ribs on each side, from one end of the fowl to the other.
The back is then laid upward, and the knife passed firmly across it,
near the middle, while the fork lifts up the other end. The side bone
are lastly to be separated; to do which turn the back from you, and on
each side the back-bone, in the direction of <i>g g</i> (<a href="#fig04"><i>fig. 4</i></a>), you will
find a joint, which you must separate, and the cutting up <a name="corr97" id="corr97"></a>of the fowl
will be complete.</p>

<p>Ducks and partridges are to be cut up in the same manner; in the latter,
however, the merrythought is seldom separated from the breast, unless
the birds are very large.</p>

</div>

<p>Turkeys and geese have slices cut on each side of the breast-bone, and
by beginning to cut from the wing upwards to the breast-bone, many more
slices may be obtained than if you cut from the breast-bone to the
wings, although I do not think the slices are quite as handsome as if
cut in the latter method.</p>

<p>Pigeons (see <a href="#fig06"><i>fig. 6</i></a>) are either cut from the neck to <i>a</i>, which is the
fairest way, or from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, which is now the most fashionable mode;
and the lower part is esteemed the best.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;">
<span class="caption">Fig. 7.</span>
<a name="fig07" id="fig07"></a><a href="images/fig07-full.png"><img src="images/fig07.png" width="377" height="203" alt="Drawing of a hare on a plate" title="Fig. 7." /></a>
</div>

<p>There are two ways of carving a hare. When it is young, the knife may be
entered near the shoulder at a (see <a href="#fig07"><i>fig. 7</i></a>),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span> and cut down to <i>b</i>, on
each side of the backbone; and thus the hare will be divided into three
parts. The back is to be again divided into four parts, where the dotted
lines are in the cut: these and the legs are considered the best parts,
though the shoulders are preferred by some, and are to be taken off in
the direction of <i>c d e</i>. The pieces should be laid neatly on the
plates, as they are separated, and each plate served with stuffing and
gravy. When the hare is old, it is better not to attempt the division
down the back, which would require much strength; but the legs should be
separated from the body at <i>f</i>, and then the meat cut off from each
side, and divided into moderate sized pieces. If the brains and ears are
required, cut off the head, and put your knife between the upper and
lower jaw, and divide them, which will enable you to lay the upper jaw
flat on the dish: then force the point of your knife into the centre,
and having cut the head into two parts, distribute the brains with the
ears to those who like them.</p>

<p>Rabbits are carved in the same manner as a hare, except that the back is
divided only into two pieces, which, with the legs, are considered the
most delicate parts.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 8.</span>

</div>

<p>A ham is generally cut in the direction of <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, (<a href="#fig08"><i>fig. 8</i></a>) down
to the bone, and through the prime part of the ham. Another way is to
cut a small hole at <i>c</i>, and to enlarge it by cutting circular pieces
out of it; this method brings you to the best part of the ham directly,
and has an advantage over the other in keeping in the gravy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 354px;">
<span class="caption">Fig. 9.</span>

</div>

<p>A leg of mutton is more easily carved than any other joint, but
nevertheless there is a mode of doing it neatly, which should be
observed. The first slice should be taken out at <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig09"><i>fig. 9</i></a>), between
the knuckle <i>b</i> and the thick end; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span> second and subsequent slices
should be cut in this direction, until you are stopped by the cramp-bone
at <i>c</i>; then turn it up, and take the remaining slices from the back, in
a longitudinal direction. When the leg is rather lean, help some fat
from the broad end with each slice. The best and most juicy slices are
toward the broad end: but some persons prefer the knuckle: and where
economy is an object, the knuckle should always be eaten when the joint
is hot, as it becomes very dry when cold. If the joint is to be brought
again to table, it has a much neater and more respectable appearance if
it be helped, altogether, from the knuckle end, when it is hot. This
direction may appear trifling; but a good economist knows the importance
of carving, when the circumstances of a family require that a joint be
brought a second time to table.</p>

<p>A haunch of venison (<a href="#fig10"><i>fig. 10</i></a>) should be cut down to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span> bone in the
direction of the line <i>a b c</i>, by which means the gravy is allowed to
flow out: then the carver, turning the broad end of the haunch toward
him, should cut in deep from <i>b</i> to <i>d</i>. He then cuts thin slices in the
same direction, taking care to give to each person whom he helps a due
proportion of fat, which is, by lovers of venison, highly prized: there
is generally more of this delicacy on the left side of <i>b d</i> than on the
other side.</p>

<p>A haunch of mutton is carved in the same manner as venison.</p>

</div>

<p>A saddle of mutton (<a href="#fig11"><i>fig. 11</i></a>) is cut from the tail to the end on each
side the back-bone, in the direction of the lines <i>a b</i>, continuing
downward to the edge <i>c</i>, until it become too fat. The slices should be
cut thin, and if the joint be a large one, they may be divided into two
parts. The fat will be found on the sides.</p>

<p>A sucking pig is cut up before it is sent to table. The <a name="corr98" id="corr98"></a>ribs may be
divided into two parts as well as the joints. The ribs are considered
the finest part, and the neck end under the shoulder. Part of the
kidneys should be added to each helping.</p>

<p>A shoulder of mutton, if properly roasted, is supposed to yield many
choice pieces, but this depends very much upon the carver. The first cut
should be in the direction <i>c b</i> (<a href="#fig12"><i>fig. 12</i></a>); and, after taking a few
slices on each side of the gap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span> which follows the first cut, some good
slices may be obtained on each side of the ridge of the shoulder blade,
in the direction <i>c d</i>. When the party is numerous, slices may be taken
from the under side; and it is on this side, under the edge <i>e</i>, that
the fat is found.<a name="FNanchor_419-1_255" id="FNanchor_419-1_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_419-1_255" class="fnanchor">419-*</a></p>

<h3 class="recipe"><i>Buttock of Beef</i></h3>

<p>Is always boiled, and requires no print to point out how it should be
carved. A thick slice should be cut off all round the buttock, that your
friends may be helped to the juicy and prime part of it. The outside
thus cut off, thin slices may then be cut from the top; but as it is a
dish that is frequently brought to table cold a second day, it should
always be cut handsome and even. When a slice all round would be
considered too much, the half, or a third, may be given with a thin
slice of fat. On one side there is a part whiter than ordinary, by some
called the white muscle. In some places, a buttock is generally divided,
and this white part sold separate, as a delicacy; but it is by no means
so, the meat being coarse and dry; whereas the darker-coloured parts,
though apparently of a coarser grain, are of a looser texture, more
tender, fuller of gravy, and better flavoured; and men of distinguishing
palates ever prefer them.</p>

<p>Other inconsistencies:</p>

<p>The position of punctuation relative to close parentheses is not
consistent. In some cases, it is inside the parentheses (i.e. ;) or ,))
and in other cases it is outside the parentheses (i.e., ); or ),). This
inconsistency has been maintained.</p>

<p>The position of the * and . in recipe numbers with * is inconsistent.</p>

<p>There is no fig. 5 in the section on carving.</p>

<p>Other changes:</p>

<p>The marketing tables for meat (pp. <a href="#Page_355">355</a> and <a href="#Page_356">356</a>), poultry (pp. <a href="#Page_357">357</a> and
<a href="#Page_358">358</a>), and vegetables (pp. <a href="#Page_358">358</a> and <a href="#Page_359">359</a>) were originally split between two
pages because of their length. Each has been joined into a single table
in this version of the book.</p>
